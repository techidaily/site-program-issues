## Resolving Issues with Wukong's Black Edition Game Crashes on Windows Computers

Even though it’s quite optimized on PC, Black Myth: Wukong still has some bugs and issues to fix on certain PC hardware device combinations. Other than the Intel 13th and 14th CPU problems ([read more here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2358720/discussions/0/6149189044492760562/)), some gamers also notice random crashing, freezing, and even black screens during or even at the very beginning of the game.

 If you’re also having trouble playing Black Myth: Wukong smoothly, here are some recommended fixes that have helped many other players. Try them and see if they do wonders for you as well.

###  Try these fixes for Black Myth Wukong crashes, freezes and black screen issues

 You don’t have to try all the following methods: simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick to fix the crashing, freezing and black screen issues in BWM for you.

1. **[If you’re using Intel 13th or 14th Gen CPU](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. [**Clean reinstall your display card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. **[Verify the game files integrity](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Close unnecessary background applications](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Repair system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

##  1\. If you’re using Intel 13th or 14th Gen CPU

 Before we move further, it should be clarified that Black Myth: Wukong might not be the one to blame for the crashes, freezes, and black screen issues in-game: as warned by the game devs, Intel 13th or 14th Gen CPU users may face error messages, instability, and crashes due to the recently revealed Intel CPU bug.

 Unfortunately, there hasn’t been an absolute fix from Intel, but other gamers and the devs propose some workarounds, including updating your BIOS, undervolting and underclocking your CPU, and reducing the performance core ratio.

 See this post for more detailed instructions on how to do them: **[Black Myth Wukong Out of Video Memory Error on PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** 

 If this is not your case, please move on to the other methods below regarding the crashing, freezing and black screen issues in Black Myth: Wukong.

##  2\. Clean reinstall your display card driver

 Another very common reason for game crashes and freezes is an outdated or faulty graphics card driver, and Black Myth: Wukong is no exception. In this case, it’s recommended that you do a clean reinstallation of the display card driver, to avoid problems from shader caches.

 To do so, DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) is usually recommended, as it can do a pretty good job removing all the older or faulty display driver files on your computer. To do a clean reinstallation of the display card driver with DDU:

1. Download DDU from the[**official download page**](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) . Then unzip the folder, and double-click the**DDU** file to further extract the execution file.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-3.png)
2. Boot your computer into Safe Mode as instructed here:[**Start Safe Mode using the System Configuration tool**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. When in Safe Mode, go to the folder where you unzip the DDU execution file. Double-click to run**Display Driver Uninstaller** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-2.png)
4. Select **GPU** and **your GPU manufacturer** on the right side. Then click **Clean and restart** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-1.png)
5. Your computer should restart when the old driver files for your graphics card are cleaned.
6. Restart your computer afterward. Your computer will now have the generic display card driver provided by Windows.

 Now it’s time to update your display card driver. Game Science recommends different approaches for different brands.

 For**AMD** graphics card users, you should install an older driver, the AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition **[24.5.1](https://www.amd.com/zh-cn/support/downloads/previous-drivers.html/graphics/radeon-rx/radeon-rx-7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx.html)**  , with driver version 23.40.33.01 for Windows 10 and Windows 11, and Windows driver store version 31.0.24033.1003.

 For**Intel** and**Nvidia** graphics card users, you should use the latest versions of the drivers available.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.** 

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[7 days free trial](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy.

## 3\. Verify the game files integrity

 For a big game like Black Myth: Wukong, it’s not strange that some game files might be missing or corrupted during the download and installation. So if you’re experiencing constant crashes and freezes in BMW, you should try to verify the game files. To do so:

### On Steam

1. Launch Steam.
2. In the **LIBRARY** , right-click on Black Myth: Wukong and select **Properties**  from the drop-down menu.  
    
![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
3. Select the **Installed Files**  tab and click on the **Verified integrity of game files**  button.

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
4. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.

### Epic Games Launcher

1. On Epic Game Launcher, find Black Myth: Wukong in your **Library** . Click **the three dots** on the right side of the game line and select **Manage** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28.png)
2. Click **Verify** to start verifying the game files.

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Then try your Black Myth: Wukong again to see if it still crashes and freezes. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix.

##  5\. Close unnecessary background applications

 As noted by Game Science, the following background applications and services could cause performance issues like crashes, stutters, low frame rate, and screen tearing in Black Myth: Wukong:

* Video recording software;
* Video streaming services and
* Third-party antivirus programs

 So if you have them running in the background, please do the following to disable them:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and**X** at the same time to select**Task Manager** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-42.png)

## 6\. Repair system files

 If you are facing persistent issues with Black Myth: Wukong and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial.

 The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.
