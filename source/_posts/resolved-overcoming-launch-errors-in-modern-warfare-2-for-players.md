## Modern Warfare MW3 Crash Mystery Solved: Overcome the Dauntinig Error 6068

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mw-6068-featured.jpg)

 Many gamers are complaining about the constant crashes that shows a**Dev Error 6068** . If you happen to be one of them, don’t worry. Here are some working fixes you can try.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you find the one that does the trick.

1. [**Run Warzone on DirectX 11**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Install all Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Stop overclocking**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Check your RAM**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. **[Increase your virtual memory](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Run Warzone on DirectX 11

 According to some gamers, the error seems to have disappeared when they**run Warzone on DirectX 11** . So you can try the same and see if this trick works for you too.

Here’s how:

1. Open your**Battle.net** client.
2. From the left menu, select**Call of Duty: MW** . Click**Options** and select**Game Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mw-d3d11.jpg)
3. From the left menu, select**Game Settings** . Check the box next to**Additional command line arguments** . In the input area, type**\-d3d11** (mind the dash). Then click**Done** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mw-d3d11-2.jpg)

Now you can launch Warzone and test the stability.

If this fix doesn’t help, you can try the next one below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The Dev Error 6068 message suggests a**DirectX** issue, which means it could be graphics-related. In other words, you might be using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . So before trying anything more complicated, definitely check if you’re using the latest GPU driver.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the graphics card manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding your model and downloading the latest correct driver installer. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your PC and see if Warzone crashes again.

 If updating your graphics driver doesn’t solve your problem, you can take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 Windows 10 offers regular updates that can**improve compatibility and security** . Keeping your system up to date helps ward off lots of issues. It might even be the potential fix for your fatal error in Warzone.

And here’s a quick guide:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) at the same time to open the Windows Settings app. Click **Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click **Check for updates** . It will take some time for Windows to download and install available updates.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 To ensure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 After installing all system updates, restart your computer and test the gameplay in Warzone.

 If this method doesn’t give you luck, simply continue to the next one below.

### Fix 4: Stop overclocking

 While it’s common belief that overclocking serves as a zero-cost performance booster, things might turn out otherwise. It actually, in some AAA titles, undermines the stability and leads to constant crashes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/afterburner.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
MSI Afterburner

 According to some gamers, high clock speed might be one of the causes of this error. So if you’re using overclocking utilities such as**MSI Afterburner, Intel Xtu (Extreme Tuning Utilities)** , try turning them off before you enter the game. And if your RAM clock speed is over 3000 MHz, try dialing it down a bit and see if it helps.

 If the error code reoccurs when you aren’t overclocking, you can check out the next solution.

### Fix 5: Check your RAM

 Some players reported that the error disappeared right after they replaced/upgraded their RAM. If this is a RAM issue, you need to**check if you’re using faulty or incompatible RAM** . The quickest way to find out is try RAM of another brand. When it comes to gaming, you can hardly go wrong with reputable brands.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gskill-1200x786.jpg)

 You should at least have 16GB for Warzone, but more is always better.

And here’re some solid brands we recommend:

* **[Crucial](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/62AABAD2-F061-478A-BF2B-B633029447D9?ingress=2&visitId=263ebac2-68f8-427a-85e0-a75ba674a2aa&ref%5F=ast%5Fblnhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/page/6F30BEE2-13F3-49BE-9AC3-23FD9C056D77?ingress=2&visitId=c48d176b-dd7c-4d83-bfb0-1000a9183878&ref%5F=ast%5Fbln&tag=drivereasycom-20)**

 Or you can check out the fix below to use virtual memory as a temporary workaround.

### Fix 6: Increase your virtual memory

 Virtual memory serves as additional RAM when your system is out of memory. This is often useful when you’re running a big and resource-hungry application.**Increasing your computer’s virtual memory** can at some point mitigate the crash.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **advanced system settings** . Click **View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/search-advanced-system-settings.jpg)
2. Under the **Performance**  section, click **Settings…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/system-advanced-performance-virtual-memory.jpg)
3. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Advanced**  tab. Under the **Virtual memory** section, click **Change…** .

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-memory-advanced.jpg)
4. Uncheck the box next to**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** . Then select **Customize size** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/virtual-memory-03.jpg)
5. Enter **Initial size** and **Maximum size** according to the physical memory of your computer. Microsoft recommends that virtual memory should be 1.5 to 3 times the size of physical memory. In my case, the physical memory (actual RAM) of my computer is 8 GB, so the **Initial size** for me here is **8 x 1024 x 1.5 = 12288 MB** , and the **Maximum size** should be **8 x 1024 x 3 = 24576 MB** . Once you’ve entered your size of virtual memory, click **Set** , then click **OK**  to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-memory-set-02.jpg)
6. Restart your computer.

Now launch Warzone and check if the problem persists.
