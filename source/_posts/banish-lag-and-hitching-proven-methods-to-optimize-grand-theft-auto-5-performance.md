## 6\. Tweak in-game settings

 For some reason, settings by default may not always give you the best result. To make sure you can enjoy Battlefield 2042 to the fullest on your own computer, adjust the following in-game settings:

* Future frame rendering:**OFF**
* Vertical sync:**OFF**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/disable-vertical-sync-and-future-frame-rendering.png)
