## Fixes for PC gamers

If you encounter the issue on your computer, try these solutions.

### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of your game files

 The dev error might suggest an integrity issue, meaning that some files within the game folders are missing or corrupted. To make sure there’s nothing wrong with your game files, you need verify their integrity:

1. Open your**Battle.net** client.
2. From the left menu, select**Call of Duty: MW** . Click**Options** and select**Scan and Repair** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warzone-verify-1.jpg)
3. Click**Begin Scan** . Then wait for the checking to complete.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warzone-verify-2.jpg)

 Now you can launch Warzone and check if the error code reoccurs during gameplay.

If this method doesn’t help you, check out the next one below.

### Fix 2: Install all Windows updates

 To avoid possible compatibility issues, you need to make sure your system is up to date. By default Windows 10 will ask you to install patches on a regular basis, but you can also check for updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 Once you’ve installed all the system updates, restart your PC and check if the problem persists.

If the issue remains, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 There’re multiple reports suggesting that the dev error 5573 is graphics-related. In other words, it could indicate that you’re using**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . If you don’t remember when was the last time you checked for drivers update, definitely do it now.

 You can update the graphics driver manually: go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), search your model and find the correct installer. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your GPU driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with**Driver Easy** :

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-2060-super-update.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated all your drivers, restart your PC and see if Warzone crashes again.

 If the latest drivers didn’t help you, simply continue to the next fix.

 If this trick doesn’t do the trick for you, move on to the next one.

 Some gamers verified that deleting the user config files will cause the game to reset and thus solve the issue. You can try the same using the following steps:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) to open the**Run** dialog. Type or paste**%USERPROFILE%Documents** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/run-open-documents.jpg)
2. Delete all files inside the folder named**Call of Duty Modern Warfare** /**Call of Duty** . (Leave the folder empty.) Then launch Warzone and check if the problem persists.

## Fixes for PC & console

The following fixes apply to both PC and console.

### Fix 1: Change to Windowed mode

 According to the feedback, changing in-game settings to Windowed mode could be a potential fix for the crash. So you can try this and see how things go.

 To do this, go to**OPTIONS** \>**GRAPHICS** . Under the**DISPLAY** section, set**Display Mode** to**Windowed** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warzone-windowed.jpg)

 If changing the display mode doesn’t solve your problem, you can try the next method.

### Fix 2: Switch to another account

 According to some, the Dev Error 5573 only appears on certain accounts. So if possible, you can**switch to another account** , then check if the crash happens again. If the problem disappears, you can contact the Activision support for further troubleshooting regarding your account.

If the issue lingers on, take a look at the next solution.

### Fix 3: Switch to Modern Warfare operators

 If you’re using an operator from Black Ops Cold War, you can try another one from Modern Warfare. Some users reported that the error disappeared when**using operators that are not from Black Ops Cold War** . It’s unclear whether it’s just a glitch or a compatibility issue.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mw-operators.jpg)

 For an overview of operators, you can check out[this page](https://www.gamesatlas.com/cod-modern-warfare/operators/) .

### Fix 4: Switch loadouts and cosmetics

 Aside from operators, it’s reported that certain**loadouts or cosmetics** are the one to blame. So if you’re using any of those, try to switch or simply unequip them and see how things go.
