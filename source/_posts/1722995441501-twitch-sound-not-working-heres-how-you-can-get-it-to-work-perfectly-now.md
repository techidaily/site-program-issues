System requirements for Snap Camera

 If the hardware meets the minimum requirements, but you haven’t updated the driver for your specific graphics card or your webcam, then you should give it a try.

There are two ways for you to update your graphics and webcam drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually –](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended) –](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1: Manually

 To update your webcam driver, you’ll need o go to your graphics or webcam manufacturer’s website and download the exact driver for your operating system, then manually install it step by step.

### Option 2: Automatically

## Fix 5: Turn off VPN services

 Using a VPN (virtual private network) is prohibited while using Snapchat or Snap Camera, so it’s preferable to turn off the VPN if you’re using one.

 Using a VPN can also lead to a temporary network block. So be sure to disable it and log into Snap Camera again.
