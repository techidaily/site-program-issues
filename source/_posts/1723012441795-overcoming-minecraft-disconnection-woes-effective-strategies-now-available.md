8. **[Reinstall your CSGO](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Restart your PC

 The first thing to do is to turn off your computer and turn it back on. – Yes, seriously. By turning off the PC, you can clean away the current state of the software, which includes any issues that have occurred.

 If_CSGO_ is still not launching after the reboot, try Fix 2, below.

### Fix 2: Reset CSGO Config to default settings

 Incorrect in-game settings can also prevent the game from launching smoothly on your device. In some cases, you may run into game performance issues after altered in-game settings. If you’ve changed the setting, or you’re not sure if you’ve changed it by mistake, follow the instructions below to reset your game settings:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to open File Explorer.

**2)** Copy and paste **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\_YOUR STEAM ID_ \\730\\local\\cfg** on the address bar.

 Where “<**_YOUR STEAM ID_** \>” is the ID of your Steam account.

**3)** Delete the**autoexec.cfg file** in the current directory.

 CSGO uses an autoexec.cfg file to ensure some commands or settings are always set. The file is automatically executed on startup.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**4)** Relaunch the game to see if this method worked.

If the problem still exists, try the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 When it comes to gameplay, your GPU is actually the most important component. And your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU.

 You should make sure your graphics driver are up to date. There are two ways you can do this:

* [**Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating the driver. To get the latest correct driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1009.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1023.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)** Relaunch your game to test the issue.

 If you’re still experiencing the launching issue after confirming you have the latest driver, try the next solution below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 4: Stop overclocking your CPU

 An unstable overclock will crash your game and the whole system. If you overclocked your GPU, that may be the core issue. Set your CPU clock speed rate back to the default to see if it fixes the issue.

If the launching problem continues to occur, go to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Verify the integrity of CSGO files

 If_CSGO_ still won’t launch, you may have one or more corrupted or outdated game files that are conflicting with the game. In this case, try verifying the integrity of your game files on Steam. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-133.png)

### Fix 6: Run **_CSGO_** as an administrator

_CSGO_ may fail to access certain game files and folders if you’re running it under a standard user account. This can cause errors when launching a game. To fix it, you can run the game as an administrator to give it high integrity access. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Exit**Steam.**

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-352-4.png)

**3)** Click **Yes** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-353-4.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**4)** Launch _CSGO_ from Steam.

If this didn’t work, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 7: Check for Windows updates

 If a game won’t run at all, it’s unlikely that the out-of-date Windows version is the core problem, but you should still rule out the possibility. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-575-7.png)

**2)**  Click **Check for updates,**  and then wait for Windows to download and install the updates automatically.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-576-6.png)

 Restart your computer after the update is complete, then try running _CSGO_ again. If the issue persists, try the fix, below.

### Fix 8: Reinstall CSGO
