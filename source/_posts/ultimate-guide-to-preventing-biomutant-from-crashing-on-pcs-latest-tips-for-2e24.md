## Ultimate Guide to Prevent Hitman 3 From Freezing on PC - Expert Tips Inside

Hitman 3, a dramatic conclusion to the Hitman series, is finally here! The story mission is exquisite and aesthetic design is stunning. However, many players are reporting the Hitman 3 crashing issue and complained they canâ€™t enjoy the game at all. If youâ€™re one of them, donâ€™t worry. After reading this post, youâ€™ll be able to rule out the common causes and get your issue fixed.

## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 simple fixes for Hitman 3 crashing. You may not try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Stop overclocking](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Use the dedicated GPU](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Increase virtual memory](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Before you move on to the troubleshooting steps below, check if your PC specs surpass the[minimum requirements](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/hitman-3/home) of Hitman 3\. If not, youâ€™ll have to upgrade your components to play the game normally.

### Fix 1 â€“ Stop overclocking

 An unstable overclocking will lead to excessive energy consumption and cause your programs to malfunction. So if youâ€™ve overclocked your CPU or GPU and then Hitman 3 crashes, try**disabling overclocking utilities like MSI Afterburner** and **setting the clock speed back to the default** . If this doesnâ€™t help, have a look at the second fix below.

### Fix 2 â€“ Use the dedicated GPU

 If you have two graphics cards installed to your computer, make sure to run Hitman 3 on your dedicated GPU, because the inbuilt card is usually underpowered for graphics-intensive games and can trigger the crashing issue. Hereâ€™s how to switch to the dedicated card in NVIDIA settings:

1. Right-click any empty space on your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .

### Fix 3 â€“ Verify the integrity of game files

1. Open your Epic Games Launcher and navigate to the**Library** tab in the left pane.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/epic-1-2.jpg)
2. Mouse over the**Hitman 3 tile** and click**the icon with three dots** at the lower right corner. Then, select**Verify** .

 Does the game works the right way or does it still crash? If the latter, donâ€™t frustrate and check out the next fix.

### Fix 4 â€“ Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to your gaming experience. If youâ€™re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, Hitman 3 is more likely to crash at startup and during the gameplay. To fix this, you should update your graphics driver to the latest, and here are two options for you:

**Option 1 â€“ Manually** : Graphics card manufacturers will keep optimizing their graphics drivers for the latest titles. To get the most recent drivers, you need to visit the manufacturersâ€™ websites like[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) . Then, search for the driver that is compatible with your Windows version and install it manually.

**Option 2 â€“ Automatically** : If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the_flagged graphics driver_ to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=195080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrwonder/images/screensaver-software.png" border="0">With Screensaver Wonder you can easily make a screensaver from your own pictures and video files.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all the drivers_ that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. Youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-2.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easyâ€™s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After the driver update, you should see Hitman 3 runs more smoothly. But if this method doesnâ€™t work, continue to the last fix below.

### Fix 5 â€“ Increase virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computerâ€™s physical memory, but when it runs low, the system performance may suffer and Hitman 3 will crash frequently. To see if thatâ€™s the case, you can increase the virtual memory via the steps below.

1. Click the**Start** button and type**advanced system settings** in the search bar. Then, click**View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-1-3.jpg)
2. Click**Settings** under Performance.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-2-2.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**Advanced** tab. Then, click**Change** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-3-2.jpg)
4. Untick**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-4-3.jpg)
5. Select the**C drive** and click**Custom size** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-5.jpg)
6. Enter the **initial size** and **maximum size** depending on the amount of RAM your PC has. Then, click **OK** .  

**Note** : According to Microsoft, you should set virtual memory no less than**1.5 times** and no more than **3 times** the amount of RAM on your computer. For example, if you have 8 GB RAM, the**Initial size** should be 8 x 1024 x 1.5 = 12288 MB while the **Maximum size** should be 8 x 1024 x 3 = 24576 MB. If you donâ€™t know how much RAM you have, read our post to[check RAM on your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-6.jpg)

 Restart the computer for changes to take effect. Once youâ€™ve done that, run Hitman 3 and the crashes should be resolved now.
