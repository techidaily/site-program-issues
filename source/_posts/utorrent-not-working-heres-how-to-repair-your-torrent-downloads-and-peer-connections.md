## UTorrent Not Working? Here’s How to Repair Your Torrent Downloads & Peer Connections

As one of the most popular BitTorrent clients around, uTorrent helps you share and download large files quickly and efficiently. However, many users report problems while downloading, such as uTorrent not connecting to peers or not downloading issues.

### What are the major causes of uTorrent not downloading?

 Most torrent sites provide pirated content. We discourage the download of such content. You should download only content that is legal in your country.

* Firewall/Antivirus
* Dead Torrent (No seeds)
* ISP (Internet Service Provider) blocking
* Incompatible VPN or proxy
* Internet connection issues

## Try these fixes

Whatever the cause is, you can fix it with the following fixes:

1. **[Allow uTorrent through Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update tracker](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Run tests in uTorrent](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Force Protocol Encryption](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Set a maximum download speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Change the incoming port](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Find a better Torrent file](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## IMPORTANT: Protect your privacy first

 Downloading torrents is perfectly legal, so long as the files you’re downloading aren’t protected under copyright.

**Downloading copyrighted shows, movies and music is illegal** , and can attract significant penalties. All the major studios actively track the IP addresses of the computers illegally downloading their works. They then contact the associated internet service providers (ISPs) and get them to trace that IP address back to you. In many countries, ISPs are legally obligated to tell the studios who you are. And even in countries where they’re _not_ legally obligated, many ISPs will share your details anyway, simply because it’s easier.

 If you plan to download copyrighted material,   **you should use a VPN so you can’t be tracked and prosecuted.** A VPN (which stands for ‘virtual private server’) hides your IP address from prying eyes.   **Our favorite VPN is [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s fast and cheap, and – most importantly – it will keep your IP address hidden.

 Note: Some VPN services are free but, as with most things in life, you get what you pay for. Free VPNs are never as good as paid ones; either they’re not as fast or reliable, or they can be forced to share your details with the authorities.

### Fix 1: Allow uTorrent through Firewall

 Firstly, you need to make sure your Windows Firewall or anti-virus app is not blocking your uTorrent.

#### 1\. Windows Firewall

 Although the uTorrent setup wizard will automatically add an exception for uTorrent in Windows Firewall, sometimes this will fail due to your third-party antivirus settings.

 To allow your uTorrent to run through Windows Firewall here is how to do it:

 1) Type**Firewall** in the search bar and select**Firewall & network protection** .

 2) Click the**Allow an app through firewall** link.

 3) Click the**Change settings** button.

 4) Scroll down to locate**uTorrent** to mark both Public and Domain and save your settings.

**A quick tip:** If the app isn’t on the list, click the**Allow another app** button to add your uTorrent app.

#### 2\. Antivirus application

 If your antivirus app is doing an excellent job, it may take over control over your Windows Firewall and block your uTorrent, thus causing uTorrent not downloading issues.

 Follow the official guidance below to check how to exactly unblock your uTorrent:

### Fix 2: Update tracker

 If your uTorrent is stuck on**connecting to peers** , it can be a temporary stale download caused by outdated seeders or trackers.

 1) Right-click and select**Update tracker** . This will immediately check for more peers.

 2) If it fails to work, close your uTorrent. Type**%APPDATA%** in the File Explorer address bar, and open the folder. Then navigate to the uTorrent folder and delete the file named**resume.DAT** .

Try launching your uTorrent again to see if it works now.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 3: Run tests in uTorrent

 The culprit can be uTorrent settings such as ports not working, you can run a quick test and let uTorrent adjust its settings automatically.

 1) Go to**Options > Setup Guide** .

 2) Click the**Run tests** button.

 uTorrent will now check your connection and will automatically adjust your settings if there are any problems.

 However, if this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry, for you can try these fixes below to change a few settings manually…

### Fix 4: Force**Protocol Encryption**

 Some of the configurations of uTorrent will interfere with your internet connection, thus causing the uTorrent not downloading issues. Here is how to fix it:

 1) Go to**Options** \>**Preferences** .

 2) Select**BitTorrent** from the left panel.

 3) Under the**Protocol Encryption** section, change the**Outgoing** option from**Disabled** to**Forced** .

 Check if it starts downloading again. If this fails, go on to try the following tricks.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 5: Set a maximum download speed

 1) Go to**Options** \>**Preferences** .

 2) Select**Bandwidth** , and you can see the**Maximum download rate limiting** is set to 0: unlimited at default. You can change it changed it to the speed that matches your download speed such as 1800 kb/s.

### Fix 6: Change the incoming port

 1) Go to**Options** \>**Preferences** \>**Connection** .

 2) Try increasing or decreasing the existing number value by 1, then hit**OK** . This can check if this issue is related to a network problem.

 The protocol can be run in almost every port number, which is why it is difficult to block. Then you need to log in to your router and change the Port Forwarding accordingly.

 3) Also, to get a faster transfer rate, you can check both**Enable UPnP** **port mapping** and**Enable NAT-PMP port mapping** , which allows you to connect directly to the seeders, then click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 New routers models support UPnP and NAT-PMP built-in but might be disabled by default. You can check the router’s manual or search how to enable them.

### Fix 7: Find a better Torrent file

 If all of these fail to solve your problem, then the problem might be your torrent file – dead torrent (no Seeds). Because uTorrent downloading is based on Peers to Peers connection (downloading files from other computers), the seeds decrease and the Torrent file becomes dead and impossible to download.

 You can search for an alternative torrent file with more seeds in one of these Torrent Websites:

* [**The Pirate Bay**](https://thepiratebay.org/) – Best Overall
* [**YTS**](https://yts.mx/) – Best for Classic Movies
* **[RARBG](https://rarbg.to/index80.php)** [](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/10-best-torrent-websites/#rarbg) – Best for New Content
* **[1337x](http://1337x.to/)** [](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/10-best-torrent-websites/#1337x) – Best Torrent Search Options
* **[Torrentz2](https://torrentz.io/)** [](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/10-best-torrent-websites/#torrentz2) – Best for Music

**TIP:** If any of these torrent sites fail to load for you, it may be because it’s blocked in your country. To get around the block, use a VPN to hide your IP address, so your ISP can’t block the site for you.   **Our favorite VPN is [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
