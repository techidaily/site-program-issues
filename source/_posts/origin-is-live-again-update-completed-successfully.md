### Fix 1: Check your computer for viruses or malware

 Perhaps you’re having a connection issue with Origin because there is a virus or malware on your computer. They may change your Internet settings or corrupt your computer file so Origin can’t go online. You should run your antivirus software to scan your computer for viruses and malware.

 If this resolves your problem, great! But if not, there are still other fixes you can try…

### Fix 2: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Your firewall or antivirus software can sometimes cause interference to Origin so it can’t connect to the Internet. To see if that’s the case for you, temporarily disable your firewall and see if the problem remains. (You may need to consult your firewall documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If this resolves your problem, you can contact the vendor of your firewall and ask them for advice. Or you can install a different antivirus solution.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when you have disabled your firewall.

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

### Fix 4: Reset your hosts file

1. Log in your computer as the administrator.
2. Open File Explorer (by pressing the**Windows logo key** and**E** on your keyboard)
3. Copy the**following address** to the address bar, then press**Enter** on your keyboard.  
%windir%\system32\drivers\etc

4. Double click**hosts** .

5. Select**Notepad** , then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdbec88bf79c.jpg)
6. **Delete** **all the content** of the file, then copy and paste the**following text** into the file.  

# Copyright (c) 1993-2006 Microsoft Corp  

#  

# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows  

#  

# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each  

# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should  

# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name  

# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one  

# space  

#  

# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual  

# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol  

#  

# For example  

#  

# 102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server  

# 38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host  

# localhost name resolution is handle within DNS itself  

# 127.0.0.1       localhost  

# ::1             localhost
