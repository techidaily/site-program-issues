### Fix 1: Disable overlays for your game

 If there is any overlay software running when you play Dark Souls 3, it may cause game crashing on startup or freezing. It’s normal to use overlays for Steam games, but some games could be incompatible with overlay software.

**Try disabling overlays for Dark Souls 3** and see if your game stops crashing.

### Fix 2: Run in Windowed mode

 If you play Dark Souls 3 in Fullscreen mode, it may crash to your desktop. In this case, you can fix your game crashing problem by switching to**Windowed mode** .

 You can go to the game options and change to Windowed mode, then re-launch your game to see if it works.

 If, unfortunately, you can’t access the game options, try modify the settings in the GraphicsConfig file.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box.

 2) Type**_%appdata%_** and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-710.png)

 3) Open**DarkSouls3** folder.

 4) Open**GraphicsConfig.xml** with notepad. Then change  
**<config><ScreenMode>FULLSCREEN</ScreenMode>**
 to  
**<config><ScreenMode>WINDOWED</ScreenMode>**

 5) Save your change and restart your game.

 Your problem still persists, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

### Fix 3: Update your video driver

 Many players have reported that the graphics card driver may be the culprit to the crashing issue, and updating the graphics driver helps resolve the problem. So you should update your graphics card driver to the latest version.

 You can update your graphics card driver by navigating to graphics manufacturer website, find the latest version for your video card, then download and install it. This requires time and computer skills.

 If you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Be sure to set the resolution to the same resolution of your monitor. Also set**Effects quality** ,**Shadow quality** , and**Light quality** to**LOW** .

If you can’t access the in-game settings, try this:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box.

 2) Type**_%appdata%_** and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-710.png)

 3) Open**DarkSouls3** folder.

 4) Open**GraphicsConfig.xml** with notepad.

 5) Change the game effect settings to Low, especially for**Effects quality** ,**Shadow quality** , and**Light quality** .

6) Save your file changes and restart your game.

Then play your game to see if it works properly.
