### Fix 1: Restart your PC

 Sometimes, certain applications running on your computer may conflict with Google Chrome, causing it to fail.

 To see if there’re any programs preventing your browser from working correctly, try restarting your PC. A simple reboot wipes away the current state of the software and fixes issues associated with it.

 If your browser still won’t open after the reboot, read on and try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and firewall and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If Chrome works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
