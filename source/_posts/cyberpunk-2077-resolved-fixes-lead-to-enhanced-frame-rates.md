## Cyberpunk 2077 and Steam: A Comprehensive Guide to Resolving Download Issues

**[Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/cyberpunk-2077?epic%5Fcreator%5Fid=28725b529b5346a38a080b6a920aa97a&epic%5Fgame%5Fid=77f2b98e2cef40c8a7437518bf420e47)**  is finally out! Players can’t wait to add it to their game list. But the issue you might be encountering is, the download on Steam is stuck at 57.4 GB or the download speed is super slow. In this article, we’ll guide you how to fix it.

## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Uncheck bonus content under DLC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Change Steam download server](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Set Steam’s priority to High](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update network adapter driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Clear download cache](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Set a bandwidth limit](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Uncheck bonus content under DLC

 If your Cyberpunk download is stuck on 57.4 GB, it probably is extracting the game files. This happens with preloaded games on Steam. So you just need a little more patience and you’ll be in. However, if you can’t wait for any longer, disabling the DLC content download may help you.

 1) Under the**LIBRARY** tab, navigate to your game**Cyberpunk 2077** . Right-click it and select**Properties** .  
  
![uncheck bonus content under DLC to fix Cyberpunk 2077 download stuck ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/click-on-Properties-on-Steam.jpg)

 2) Select the tab**DLC** . Then uncheck the box**Cyberpunk 2077 Bonus Content** . (If the DLC portion isn’t popping up for you, try restarting your computer and after that, try to log in to your Steam account.)  
  
![uncheck bonus content under DLC to fix Cyberpunk 2077 download stuck ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DLC-uncheck-install.jpg)

 Once done, you should be able to fix the game stuck at 57.4/64 GB issue. If this didn’t work for you, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Change Steam download server

 When there are so many players downloading the game, servers might be overloaded. Changing Steam download server can help you fix it. Here are the steps you can take:

 1) From your Steam Client, open the Settings panel by selecting**Steam** \>**Settings** from the top left client menu.  
  
![change the Steam download server location](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/change-the-download-server-location.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 2) In the Settings panel, select the**Downloads** tab. Then in the**Download Region** section, choose another download region in the drop-down menu. According to the tests, Asian servers can substantially increase your download speed. It’s probably because there’s less traffic congestion.  
  
![change Steam download server](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/change-the-download-server-location-donwnload-region.jpg)
  
 After applying the changes, resume your download to check if this boosts your download speed.

 You can also check[Steam Download Stats](https://store.steampowered.com/stats/content/) to avoid the high traffic.

## Fix 4: Update network adapter driver

 Whether you have a slow download speed or you’re stuck at downloading, it could be an issue related to your network connection. And your outdated network adapter driver can be the culprit. To fix it, you’re supposed to update your network adapter driver, especially if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated it.

 You can manually update your network adapter driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website to download and install the correct network driver for your system.

OR

 You can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
