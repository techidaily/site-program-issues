### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

 When it comes to video game crashing, the most possible cause is your graphics driver. A Graphics card (GPU) is the most important component to determine your gaming performance. Therefore, if the graphics driver is outdated or corrupted, it’s very likely that you will get enormous Modern Warfare crashing. Modern Warfare crashing can be caused by corrupted graphics card drivers.

 To update your graphics driver, you have two options: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 Download the latest & correct graphics driver from the manufacturer’s website:

* [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Once downloaded, open the driver file and install the latest driver manually.

 The manual updating process is time-consuming. You’ll need to check for updates again and again since the graphics card manufacturers keep releasing new drivers to fix bugs and improve performance for certain games. You may be amazed at how often you miss a driver update for your graphics card.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically

 Updating your graphics driver automatically is quite easy. Simply download and run[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and it will recognize your system and find the correct & latest driver for it. Also, you can also update other related drivers such as audio driver, keyboard driver, etc.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Driver-Easy-Scan-Now.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to your graphics card to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install it.

**OR**

 Click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , which comes with**Full Support** and a**30-day Money Back Guarantee** . You will be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Free-Pro.jpg)

4) Restart your PC for the changes to take full effect.

### Fix 3: Set texture quality to high or normal

 Many Call of Duty players may set their graphics settings to**Low** , which can be the culprit of the Modern Warfare crashing issue. Modern Warfare may crash for not having enough texture quality, especially if you get an error code**Dev Error 6178** . Many gamers find**setting Texture Resolution to Normal or High** solved their crashing issues, depending on your PC specs.

Here’s how to do it:

 1) Open your Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and go to**Options** \>**Game Settings** \>**Graphics** .

 2) Under the**Details & Texture** tab, set**Texture Resolution** to**High** or**Normal** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/texture-resolution-to-normal-or-high-1200x628.jpg)

 You can keep everything else on the lowest settings, except Texture Filter Anisotropic on High. Also, make sure to turn off**Sync Every Frame (V-Sync)** , which is best left off within games.

Play Modern Warfare again to see if the crashing issue persists.

### Fix 5: Stop Overclocking

 Overclocking your CPU can improve your gaming performance but may leave your game unstable, which may cause Modern Warfare to crash.

### Fix 6: Disable NVIDIA V-Sync for Modern Warfare

 The V-Sync in your game is G-Sync/FreeSync and it may interfere with Modern Warfare, so you can try turning it off to see if the crashing issue goes away. If you have in-game V-sync turned on, you can disable it in Modern Warfare graphics settings.

Here’s how to turn off V-Sync in NVIDIA Control Panel:

 1) Right-click your Desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NVIDIA-Control-Panel.jpg)

 2) On the left pane, go to**3D Settings** \>**Manage 3D settings** . Select the**Program Settings** tab and add your Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

 Default Path: **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Call of Duty Modern Warfare\\ModernWarfare.exe**

 3) Scroll down the list and select**Off** for**Vertical sync** . Then click**Apply** .

### Fix 7: Disable Discord in-game overlay

 If you’re using any programs with overlay features such as Discord, disable the In-Game Overlay as it will cause random game crashes on your PC.

1) Open Discord and click the settings icon.

2) Navigate to the**Overlay** tab on the left pane.

3) Toggle off**Enable in-game overlay** .

 If you want to disable in-game overlay just for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, go to the**Games Activity** tab and toggle off Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

### Fix 8: Change Priority

 Setting Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to high priority, according to a few players, reduces the number of crashes a little bit. To do it, you need to open your game first because you’re going to find it in the Task Manager.

 1) Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager, then go to the**Details** tab.

 2) Locate**Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.exe** and right-click it.

 3) Select**Priority** \>**High** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/priority.jpg)

 4) When prompted for permission to make changes, select**Change Priority** .

### Fix 9\. Repair your system files

 If the Modern Warfare shares the same system files with your operating system, and the specific file is corrupt or missing, thus causing your game to crash, you may need to restore it with one of the following:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-modern-warfare-crashing-on-pc/#reimage)**  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Modern Warfare crashing. It will deal with issues related to system errors, critical system files and find the right fix for you.
* **[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there’re any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

#### Option 2 – Manually

 To check and restore your system file might take time and computer skills. You will need to run numerous commands, wait for the process to complete, or risk your personal data.

##### Step 1\. Scan**corrupt files with System File Checker**

 System File Checker (SFC) is a Windows built-in tool to identify and repair corrupted system files.

 1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time to open the Run box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt, type the following command and hit**Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 4) You may receive something like the following messages after the verification.

* no errors
* it fixed some errors
* could not fix all errors
* could not fix errors at all
* ……

 No matter what message you receive, you can try running**dism.exe** (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) to further scan the health of your PC.

##### Step 2.**Run dism.exe**

1) Run Command Prompt as admin and enter the following commands.

* This command line will scan the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

* This command line will restore the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 2) After the restore health process finishes, you may get some error messages.

* If restore heath gave you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** with the restore health scan, reboot your PC and run this command line.

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 If the System File Check finds any files corrupted, follow the on-screen instructions to repair them, and then restart your computer for the changes to take full effect.
