## Fix 1: Restart your PC

## Fix 2: Check your browser

 When you choose a game on Roblox’s website and click to play, there should be a pop-up window that allows you to open the Roblox app. If the pop-up window doesn’t show in your browser, or it won’t launch Roblox with your permission, then you can**try using another browser** .

 In addition,**check if your browser is up-to-date** . If not, update it then test the issue. Some players are also able to launch Roblox after they**clear the browser’s cache** , so it’s definitely worth trying.

 If your browser doesn’t seem to be the reason for Roblox not working, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Reset your Internet options

## Bonus: How to keep your PC at top condition and bring a better gaming experience

 One of the easiest PC maintenance tips is to keep your drivers up-to-date. Updating your drivers regularly helps prevent many random issues you may run into.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your drivers[via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Just note that Windows doesn’t always give you the latest version you might need, since its database isn’t updated very frequently.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your PC and your Windows version, and it will download and install the drivers correctly:

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)

 3) For example, I want to update my graphics and network adapter driver here. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged drivers to automatically download the correct version of them. Then you can manually install them (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-01-04.jpg) **The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.
