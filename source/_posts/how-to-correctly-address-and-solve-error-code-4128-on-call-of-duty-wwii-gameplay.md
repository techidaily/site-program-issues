### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of CoD Vanguard crash and error code is a faulty or outdated graphics driver. So you should update the graphics driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways you can do so:

**Manual driver update** – You can update the graphics driver manually by going to the GPU manufacturer’s website[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) . Simply find the driver that’s corresponding with your operating system, download and install it manually.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

 Reboot your computer for the changes to take effect. If the error code reoccurs, try the next solution.

### Fix 4 – Close background applications

 If you’re running multiple applications in the background, they might interfere with Vanguard and lead to a fatal dev error like 5573\. To enjoy a smooth gaming experience, it’s recommended you disable all the unnecessary programs such as antivirus, overlay programs or gaming optimization tools like_NZXT CAM, MSI Afterburner_ , and _Razer Cortex_ . Here is how:

1. Right-click any empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1-8.jpg)
2. Right-click the resource-demanding process and click**End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-2-1.jpg)

 Don’t end any programs you’re not familiar with, as they may be critical to the functioning of your computer.

 Launch the game to see if you’re able to play it normally. If not, there’s one more fix you can try.

### Fix 5 – Repair corrupt system files

 If none of the solutions above works, the last thing you need to do is to check your system. System file corruption will also crash your games and trigger a dev error code. You can check for any missing or damaged system files with a professional PC repair tool like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and optimize your computer for maximum performance.

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  works by replacing the corrupted and deleted files with fresh Windows files and components from a continuously updated online database. It’s like a clean Windows reinstallation but you won’t lose any custom settings or data during this process.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.
