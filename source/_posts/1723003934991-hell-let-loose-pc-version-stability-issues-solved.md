### Before getting started

 Halo 3 could be crashing because you’re running it beyond your computer’s abilities. So make sure your computer meets the requirements for the game.

| OS                | Windows 7 x64-based                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| CPU               | Intel Core i7-975 \| AMD A 12-9800 APU |
| GPU               | GeForce GTS 450 \| Radeon R7 Graphics  |
| Storage           | 55 GB available                        |
| Screen resolution | 1920\*1080                             |

_Halo 3 Minimum System Requirements_

 If your computer meets these requirements but still Halo 3 doesn’t launch properly, try the methods below.

## Fix 3: Update your video card drivers

 A range of gaming problems such as crashing and freezing is caused by a wrong, faulty, or outdated graphics driver. Halo 3 is no exception. To enjoy smooth gameplay, you should always keep your graphics driver up to date.

 You can search for the latest graphics driver from your graphics card’s manufacturer [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and then manually install it. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

## Fix 5: Run Halo 3 as an administrator

 If you’ve tried all the fixes above and still haven’t resolved the Halo 3 crashing issue, then you should try running the game as an administrator.

 1) Right-click the**Halo 3** icon on your desktop and select**Properties** .  
  
![open as an administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-Properties.jpg)
  
 2) Click the**Compatibility** tab and click**Run this program as an administrator** . Click**Apply** and**OK** .  
  
![run as administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-compatability.jpg)
  
 3) Go to the directory where you installed Halo 3, and run the**.exe** file as administrator as well.  
  
 4) Relaunch Halo 3.  
  
 If the problem still persists, then try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Install the latest game patch

 When a new game is released, there are still many bugs in it. And those bugs might cause the game crash issues. So developers keep updating the games to fix the bugs and improve the gaming performance.  
  
 So if there is a patch available, download and install it, then run the game again to check if the problem is solved. If it isn’t, or there is no new patch available, then move on to Fix 7.

---

## Fix 7: Verify the integrity of game files

 Halo 3 is available on PC through Steam. But players have been experiencing sudden crashes in Halo 3 on Steam. It can be caused by a bad game cache, so you need to ensure that the integrity of game files is intact.  
  
 1) Run Steam  
  
 2) Click the**LIBRARY** tab.
