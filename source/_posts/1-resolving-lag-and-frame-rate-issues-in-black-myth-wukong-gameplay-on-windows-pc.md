##  1\. Install Black Myth Wukong on your SSD

 Even though Black Myth: Wukong supports HDDs, it’s recommended that you install the game on the SSD, if you want a smoother and better gaming experience.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-12.png)
3. Then launch Steam, and select Black Myth: Wukong. Click the**gear icon** on the right side and select**Manage** , then**Browse local files** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/browse-file-location.png)
4. See if your BMW is installed on your SSD. For instance, my C drive is an SSD, and my BWM is installed on my C drive.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/file-locale.png)
5. If you already have the game installed on your SSD, just skip ahead to the next method below.

 If you’ve already had BMW installed on Steam, and you don’t want to install the game all over again, you can do the following to move the game to the SSD:

1. Launch the Steam client, and click**Steam** \>**Settings** on the top left corner.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/steam-settings.png)
2. Select**Storage** . Click the**down arrow** to expand the current drive, then click**Add Drive** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/add-drive.png)
3. Select the SSD that you want to create the library folder on, and click**Add** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/add-drive-steam.png)
4. A new drive will appear on your Steam Storage interface.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/new-drive.png)
5. Then select the drive that has Black Myth: Wukong installed,**tick the box** next to BMW, and click**Move** in the bottom right.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/move-game.png)
6. Select the drive with your new steam folder, and then click**Move** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/confirm-move.png)
7. As BMW is a bit big in size, the process could take some time, so please be prepared to wait for the whole process to finish.

 If installing Black Myth: Wukong on your SSD doesn’t help with the lags, stutters or frame rate dopping issues, please move on to the next method.

##  2\. Ensure your computer is not overheating

 If you’re playing BMW on a laptop, it’s possible that the cooling system is not powerful enough to keep your computer cool when the game is running. In that case, your laptop could get overheat, and Wukong will then suffer from frame rate drops and lags problems. To alleviate it, simply put your laptop on a stand, or better if you have a cooling pad.

 If you’re using a desktop, and you’re computer case is running hot, you may need to clean the dust and try an extra case fan.

 If this is not why Black Myth: Wukong lags, stutters, or has FPS dropping issues for you, please move on to the next method below.
