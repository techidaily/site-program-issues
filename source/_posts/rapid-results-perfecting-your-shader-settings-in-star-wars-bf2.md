 Once you’ve done these, launch your game. This time, while loading into the game, you’ll notice that it simply skips the shaders’ installation completely. This means that you should be able to play the game without any issues.

 After you successfully launched the game, it may re-enable the DirectX 12 mode automatically or it won’t. If it won’t, you can manually re-enable it.

## Re-enable DirectX 12 mode

 1) Go to the game’s main menu and head across to the**OPTIONS** screen. Then select**VIDEO** .

## Why disabling DirectX 12 works

 It’s possible that DirectX 12 could offer some enhancements for your machine, using DirectX 11 should allow the software to run much more reliably and stably. Basically, while the game is running in DirectX 12 mode, it’s able to pre-cache certain shaders so that you can get much better performance in-game. But chances are, the game might not be launching as expected.

 In conclusion, disabling the DirectX 12 may cost you certain visual aesthetics, but nothing substantial. And at least this is the quickest way to get into the game and it’s easy to re-enable it.
