### Fix 1: Run Witcher 3 as Administrator

 Witcher 3 sometimes can’t access certain game files on your PC under normal user mode, which could be the cause of the not launching issue. To fix it, you can try running both of your**Steam/GOG** and**Witcher 3** as administrators.

#### 1\. Run Steam/GOG as Administrator

 1) Right-click your Steam/GOG, and select**Properties** .

 2) Select the**Compatibility** tab, and tick the**Run this program as an administrator** box. Then click**Apply** \>**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2.jpg)

 This will ensure you have administrative privileges every time you open Steam/GOG.

#### 2\. Run Witcher 3 as administrator

 You need to start Witcher 3 in admin mode as well to have full access to the game file. Also, you should run the game in compatibility mode with previous operating systems.

 1) Go to the folder where you installed your Witcher 3 and find the Witcher 3 executable file.

The executable for the game is located in:

* **For GOG:** GOG Games\\The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt\\bin\\x64\\witcher3.exe
* **For Steam:** steam\\steamapps\\common\\The Witcher 3\\bin\\x64\\witcher3.exe

**Note:** If you can’t find Witcher 3.exe, you can right-click on the game in Steam>**Properties** \>**LOCAL FILES** \>**BROWSE LOCAL FILES** .

 2) Right-click your Witcher 3 application and select**Properties** .

### Fix 2: Remove Mods

 If you have added any mods to Witcher 3, you can uninstall them to see if it works. Witcher 3 may have been worked fine with the mods before, but mods can be unpredictable at times.

 Just delete the mods subfolder within the Witcher 3 folder and it should work. After that, you can launch the game to test the issue. If you can launch the game normally, then great! If not, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Update device drivers

 Witcher 3 not launching is probably caused by driver issues. If your device drivers (especially your graphics driver) are outdated or corrupt, you may bump into Witcher 3 not launching or crashing issues. To improve your gaming experience and fix bugs, you should always have the latest graphics driver installed.

There are two ways for you to update your drivers:

**Option 1 – Manually –** You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**OR**

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended) –** This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 NVIDIA and AMD keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to their official website, download the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 64-bit) and install the driver manually.

* For NVIDIA: Go to[**NVIDIA Driver Downloads**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NVIDIA-driver-1.jpg)
* For AMD: Go to **[AMD Drivers & Support](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AMD-driver-downloads-1.jpg)

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. After that, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **All the drivers in Driver Easy come straight from the manufacturer. They’re all authorized and secure.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/scan-now-7.png)

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** .)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/update-all-your-drivers-4.jpg)

**Note:** You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

4) Restart your PC and launch Witcher 3 again to test the issue.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of game files

 If you have the latest graphics driver installed but Witcher still won’t launch, then the culprit could be corrupt game files.

* For GOG:  
   1. Launch GOG Galaxy  
   2. Go to the**Game** tab.  
   3. Click**MORE** \>**Manage installation** \>**Verify / Repair** \>**VERIFY GAME** .
* For Steam:  
   1. Launch Steam  
   2. Go to**Library** .  
   3. Right-click Witcher 3 and select Properties.  
   4. Select the Local files tab and click Verify integrity of game cache.
* For Origin:  
   1. Launch Origin  
   2. Select My Games.  
   3. Right-click the game, and select**Repair Game** .

 After repairing the game files, relaunch your Witcher 3 to see if the issue still persists.

 If Witcher 3 still won’t launch, there might be something wrong with your system files. Try the next fix below to check for system file corruption using the System file checker.

### Fix 5: Run system file checker

 System File Checker is an in-build tool for scanning corrupt system files, and it will repair any detected missing or corrupt files.

 1) Type cmd in the Search box. Then right-click**Command Prompt** and select**Run as administrator** .

<a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5.jpg)

 2) Type the command:**sfc /scannow** in the window and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 3) Wait for the verification process to finish. This may take 3-5 minutes.

 When the verification finishes, you may receive one of the following messages:

* **Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations** .  
 It means you don’t have any missing or corrupted system files. You can go ahead with the next fix to solve your problem.
* **Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them**  
 You can perform a restart and try to relaunch the game to see if Witcher 3 not launching issue is gone.

 If you receive neither of these messages, you can click **[Microsoft Support Page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system)**  to further fix your problem with File Checker Tool.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Disable in-game overlay

 Sometimes in-game overlay can screw over your game and your Witcher 3 not launching issue may be caused by this feature. The game simply takes a lot of time to react when the overlay is on.

 To make sure if this is your problem, you can go to the directory where you installed the game, and run Witcher 3 .exe here. If this method works, you can go to your Game launcher and turn off the in-game overlay.

* **For GOG:**  
  * On the game’s library page select**Settings** \> Uncheck the**In-Game Overlay** box. Then click**OK** .
* **For Steam:**  
  * Right-click the game in your**Library** \> Select**Properties** \> Under the**General** tab, uncheck the box next to**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game**
* **For Origin:**  
  * click on Origin at the top-left corner of the window > select**Application Setting** \>**More** \>**ORIGIN IN-GAME** \> move the slider to turn off**Enable Origin In-Game**

 After disabling the in-game overlay, you can launch your Witcher 3 again. If Witcher 3 launches successfully, then great! But if it doesn’t, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 7: Disable Antivirus

 Witcher 3 not launching problem is sometimes caused by interference from your antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists.

 Alternatively, you can add the entire folder where Witcher 3 is installed to its list of exclusions.

Follow the links below to learn how to do it:

Try launching your game again to see if Witcher 3 works normally again.

### Fix 8: Perform a clean boot

 Your Witcher 3 not launching can be caused by other conflicting applications. To see if that’s your problem, try performing a clean boot.

 1) Type**msconfig** in the Search box and select**System Configuration** .

5) Restart your PC and launch Witcher 3 again.

 If Witcher 3 launches successfully again, then congrats! However, you’ll need to find out the problematic software. Here is how to do it:

* Open the System Configuration again.
* Enable services and applications that you’ve disabled before one by one until you find the problematic one.
* After enabling each startup application, you need to restart your computer again to find the conflicting one.

 Once you find out the problematic software, you may need to uninstall or disable it to avoid running into the same issue in the future .

### Fix 9: Delete the GoG.dll

 If you ever transferred your Witcher 3 from GOG to Steam, there might be two .dll files in your**Steam > steamapps > common > The Witcher 3 > bin** folder. One of them is Steam.dll and the other is GoG.dll. You may delete the**GoG.dl** l file and try running Witcher 3 again to test your issue.

### Fix 10: Perform a reinstall

 If the methods above fail to solve your problem, you can reinstall Witcher 3 to see if the issue persists.

 1) Press the**Windows** key +**R** at the same time to open the Run box.

 2) Type**appwiz.cpl** in the box and hit**Enter** .
