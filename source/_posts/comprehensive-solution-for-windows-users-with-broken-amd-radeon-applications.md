## Fix Your Hearthstone Crashes and Glitches on Windows - Solutions Inside

Hearthstone keeps crashing on startup or during a match? Making like a thousand attempts to relaunch it but it ends up not responding or shutting down? If you’re in the same situation, don’t panic. This post is going to help you with the irritating Hearthstone crashing on PC.

## Before getting started

 Before you begin troubleshooting, make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements to launch Hearthstone. If it doesn’t, you have to run Hearthstone on another computer or upgrade your PC.

| **Operating system** | Windows® 7 / Windows® 8 / Windows® 10                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Processor**        | Intel® Pentium® D or AMD® Athlon™ 64 X2                      |
| **Video**            | NVIDIA® GeForce® 8600 GT or ATI™ Radeon™ HD 2600XT or better |
| **Memory**           | 3 GB RAM                                                     |
| **Storage**          | 3 GB available HD space                                      |

 After confirming your computer meets the minimum specs, you can move on towards the fixes below.

## Fixes to try

 There are various causes for Hearthstone crashing, such as corrupt game files, outdated drivers, or conflicting third-party programs. We cover a set of easy and quick solutions that help other players solve the issue.

 You don’t have to try them all, just work your way through the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Run Hearthstone as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Scan and repair game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Temporarily disable the anti-virus programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Delete the Hearthstone folder](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Perform a clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Reinstall Hearthstone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Run Hearthstone as administrator

 Windows runs Hearthstone in user mode by default, but that might keep it from accessing certain files and cause the crashes. To see if that’s the case, you could run Hearthstone as administrator and relaunch the game.

**1)** Right click the Hearthstone icon on your desktop and select**Properties** .

**2)** Select the**Compatibility** tab, check**Run this program as an administrator** , and click**OK** .

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 An old, incompatible or faulty graphics driver will result in various gaming problems such as lagging, freezing and crashing. So if you’re an avid gamer and look forward to the smooth gameplay of Hearthstone, you should keep your GPU driver up to date at all times.

There are two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphic card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-1-1.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

### Fix 4 – Temporarily disable the anti-virus programs

 Sometimes the third-party anti-virus programs will interfere with Hearthstone and prevent it from launching or running. Temporarily**disable any anti-virus programs** you’re using to determine if it’s the cause.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

 If this resolves the problem, you’ll need to**add Hearthstone to the exclusion list** of your anti-virus programs. You could also switch to a different solution for virus protection, or contact the vendor of your software for further assistance.

 If the anti-virus applications aren’t to blame for your crashing issue, go ahead with Fix 5.

### Fix 5 – Delete the Hearthstone folder

 Many users managed to start Hearthstone normally by deleting the Hearthstone folder. Here’s how:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then, type**%localappdata%\\blizzard** and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8-1-4.jpg)

**2)** Right click the Hearthstone folder and click**Delete** , or just move it to another location.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Relaunch Hearthstone to see if you get rid of the crashing issue. If not, keep reading the next fix.

### Fix 6 – Perform a clean boot

 Some services or applications running in the background may also conflict with Hearthstone. A clean boot allows Windows to start up with only critical drivers and programs, so you’ll know if any other software is hindering your game.

**1)** Type**system configuration** in the search bar, and click**System Configuration** .

**6)** Click**Restart** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-2-4.jpg)

 After your computer restarts, launch Hearthstone to test if the issue has been solved.

 If your game runs correctly now,**enable the startup items one at a time** and restart your computer. Repeat this step until you find out the problematic software that stops Hearthstone from working. You may need to uninstall it to avoid the crashing issue, or contact software developer for further support.

**IMPORTANT** : Once you’ve completed the troubleshooting process, you have to reset your computer to start normally. Follow the instruction below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then, type**msconfig** and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9-1.jpg)

**2)** Click the**Normal startup** button, and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9-2-1.jpg)
