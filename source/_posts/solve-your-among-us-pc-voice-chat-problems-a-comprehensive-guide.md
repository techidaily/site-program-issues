Players have been reported encountering an error**ERR\_GFX\_STATE** while trying to launch the game **[Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/red-dead-redemption-2?epic%5Fcreator%5Fid=28725b529b5346a38a080b6a920aa97a&epic%5Fgame%5Fid=b30b6d1b4dfd4dcc93b5490be5e094e5)**  . Then the game crashes. If it also happened to you, you should be able to fix it by trying the methods in this post.

![Quick Fix | Red Dead Redemption 2 ERR_GFX_STATE Crash - Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/featured-image-4.jpg)

## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Disable overclocking](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Clean update the graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Verify game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Change the API settings file](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Delete SGA files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Specify launch arguments](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Disable overclocking

 If you’re using MSI Afterburner or other GPU tweaking programs, you’re more likely to get this error message. The game engine doesn’t really support cards that are overclocked. And overclocking can cause game instability and thus the game might crash. So to fix it, you should disable any overclocking settings for your CPU and/or GPU.

## Fix 2: Clean update the graphics driver

 If downloading didn’t help, your faulty or outdated graphics driver may be the culprit and generate the ERR\_GFX\_STATE error. To fix it, you can try to do a clean update of the graphics card driver. To do so, DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) is usually recommended, as it can do a pretty good job removing all the older or faulty display driver files on your computer.

To do a clean reinstallation of the display card driver with DDU:

1. Download and search for the execution file of the display card driver from the website of your GPU manufacturer:  
   * **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  
   * **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  
   * **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**
2. Download DDU from the[**official download page**](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) . Then unzip the folder, and double-click the**DDU** file to further extract the execution file.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-3.png)
3. Boot your computer into Safe Mode as instructed here:[**Start Safe Mode using the System Configuration tool**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. When in Safe Mode, go to the folder where you unzip the DDU execution file. Double-click to run**Display Driver Uninstaller** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-2.png)
5. Select **GPU** and **your GPU manufacturer** on the right side. Then click **Clean and restart** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-1.png)
6. Your computer should restart when the old driver files for your graphics card are cleaned.

7. Double-click the setup file for the display card driver you’ve downloaded from step 1 to run the driver installation.

## Fix 3: Verify game files

 Corrupted or missing files could also relate to the Red Dead Redemption 2 ERR\_GFX\_STATE error. To see if this is the case, you can verify your game files on:

* **[Epic Games Launcher](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Rockstar Games Launcher](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Epic Games Launcher

2. Click **Verify** to start verifying the game files.

## Fix 4: Change the API settings file

 According to users in the comment section, changing the Vulkan to DX12 in the API settings file fixes the ERR\_GFX\_STATE error in Red Dead Redemption 2 for them. To see if this does wonders for you:

1. Go to **C:\\Users\\ _(your user name)_  \\Documents\\Rockstar Games\\Red Dead Redemption 2\\Settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rdr2-settings.png)
2. Right-click the**system.xml** file and open it with an editor. Here, we use Visual Studio Code, but you can go with Notepad, Notepad++ or any other similar editor.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rdr2-settings-edit.png)
3. Change the API Settings from**Vulkan** to**DX12** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/api-vulkan.png)  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/api-dx12.png)

4. Save the change.

 See if the ERR\_GFX\_STATE error in Red Dead Redemption 2 remains. If so, please move on.

## Fix 5: Delete SGA files

 Files with the extension**SGA** are created for the game. They are compressed files often containing maps or large groups of related files. But there are situations that these files cause crashing or other errors in your game. So to fix it, you should delete them. To do so, simply follow the instructions below:

1. Go to **C:\\Users\\ _(your user name)_  \\Documents\\Rockstar Games\\Red Dead Redemption 2\\Settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rdr2-settings.png)
2. Now you can see three files that begin with**sga** . These are the files that cause the error. So you need to delete them. And your game would not crash again.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif" border="0">Forex Robotron Basic Package</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/files-that-begin-with-sga.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If deleting these files didn’t work for you, you can alternatively create three empty text files of size 0B and make those files read-only. Also, change the names to**sga\_xxx** accordingly. This might be very specific to your setup and the true root cause you’re having.

## Fix 6: Specify launch arguments

 Command line arguments are extra commands you can use when launching your game so that the game’s functionality will change. To get rid of the ERR\_GFX\_STATE error, you can define launch arguments to make your game run with certain parameters.

 To do this, simply click on the link below based on the launcher you’re using:

 To conclude, there are different bugs that cause this same error message. It can happen if your GPU is overclocked, it can happen if your RAM is overclocked. Players can get it randomly. It appears to just be a generic message and that’s why there are so many solutions that only work for a small number of people. But I hope the fixes in this post can help you resolve the problem and you can play your game smoothly.
