## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 When you encounter performance issues with your game, it’s high time you consider if you’re using an outdated graphics driver. Outdated drivers can introduce compatibility issues.

 Another reason you should check for driver updates is that famous graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to offer players a smooth gameplay. So this is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics driver

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network adapter driver manually, you can, instead, do it**automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 After this, restart your computer to make sure it’s applied. Then test your gameplay. If disabling hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling doesn’t make any difference, proceed to the next fix.

## 5\. Delete the cache for the game

 Some players reported on Reddit that deleting the game cache helped them reduce the in-game stutters. So you can give it a try and see how it works.

1. Head to**C/Users/username/Documents/Battlefield 2042** or directly go to the**Document** folder on your PC.
2. Open the**Cache** folder. Press**Ctrl + A** keys simultaneously to select all the files. Then right-click and select Delete to delete all the files.

## 6\. Tweak in-game settings

 For some reason, settings by default may not always give you the best result. To make sure you can enjoy Battlefield 2042 to the fullest on your own computer, adjust the following in-game settings:

* Future frame rendering:**OFF**
* Vertical sync:**OFF**
