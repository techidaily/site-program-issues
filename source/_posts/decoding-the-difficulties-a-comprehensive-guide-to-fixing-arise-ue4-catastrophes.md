## Disable Movie / Film Grain, Depth Of Field, Post-Process Effects

 The in-game graphics settings like Movie / Film Grain, Depth Of Field and Post-Process Effects are common in video games. However, those in-game graphics settings are also the main cause of FPS drops and crashing.

 The game doesn’t provide options to disable those in-game graphics settings. If you need to disble those settings, follow the instructions below:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Copy the path below and paste it to the Run dialog. Then click OK to open it.  
**`%LOCALAPPDATA%\TheAscent\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor`**  
![Run dialog](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Run-dialog.jpg)
2. Open the file**Engine.ini** in Notepad.
3. To disble Moive / Film Grain, add the following and save the file:  

` **[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.Tonemapper.Quality=3**  
 **r.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization=0** `
4. Add the following to the Engine.ini file and save it to disable Depth of Field:  

**`[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0`**
5. If you’d like to disable all of them, then don’t add these commands separately. Do it like this:  

**`[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.SceneColorFringeQuality=0**  
 **r.Tonemapper.Quality=3**  
 **r.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization=0**  
 **r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0`**
6. Launch the game again after you save the Engine.ini file.

 See if it crashes after you disable those in-game graphics settings. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Update MS Visual C++ Redistributables

 To ensure compatibility, you may also need to update your Microsoft Visual C++ redistributables, because the outdated Visual C++ redistributables may also trigger The Ascent crashing issues.

 You can download its installation files via the links below on your own and manually install them on your PC.

* [Visual C++ Redistributables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0)

 Restart Windows OS after you installed the Visual C++ Redistributables. Then launch the game and see if the game crashes.

 If not, congratulations, you’ve resolved this issue! If this issue reappears, try the next fix, below.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Run The Ascent and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.
