![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Disable-the-Steam-Overlay-for-Resident-Evil-Village-2.jpg)
4. Run Resident Evil Village to see if the crashing problem is fixed. If it doesn’t cut it, please try**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Run Steam as administrator

 Your game may crash if it does not have the resources required to run fully. As a fix, you can try running Steam as administrator.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **epic** , then right-click on **Steam**  and click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/123-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
6. Re-launch Resident Evil Village to see if it can be played properly. If yes, then congrats! If it’s still no joy, please try **Fix 6** , below.

### Fix 6: Close background apps

 Having too many apps running in the background at the same time may also cause your game to crash. These apps compete for CPU, memory and even induce instability issues. So it makes sense that while you’re playing the game, you close these resources hungry applications and services.

Here’s how to close background apps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** **key** , then press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** keys at the same time to bring up Task Manager.
2. Select the**Startup** tab, then right-click on each item and click**Disable** .

 RE8 still crashes? Don’t worry – there’s a couple more fixes for you to try.

### Fix 7: Disable HDR in RE 8 and Windows

 Resident Evil Village supports High-Dynamic Range (HDR), which is a technology used to enhance contrast and colors in graphics rendering and bring about more life-like images. This may be the case, but according to some players, it could be the cause of the crash.

 So, it’s recommended that you turn off HDR mode (both in RE8 and in Windows if your monitor supports HDR) to see if it helps with the situation.

**How to turn off HDR in Resident Evil Village** :

1. Open Steam.
2. Go to**Library** , then right-click on**Resident Evil Village** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Resident-Evil-Village-steam-properties-1.png)
3. Click**Local** \>**Browse…** .

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type**desk.cpl** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/desk.cpl_.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Once you have disabled HDR, run the game in the client and see if it still crashes. If it’s still on-going, please move on to **Fix 8** .

### Fix 8: Install the latest patch

 The game crash is likely to be a bug that comes along previous updates, which requires to be patched in the next release. To check if this is the case, you can install the latest patch, then run the game again to see if the crashing problem ceases.

 If there’s no new patch available, or the problem remains after installing the latest patch, head on to **Fix 9** , below.

### Fix 9: Perform a clean boot

 Another possible cause of Resident Evil Village crashing on your PC is software conflict.

 To identify if this is the reason, you should perform a clean boot on Windows. A clean boot starts Windows with the essential programs, so that you will know if a background program is interfering with the game, or the problem lies elsewhere. If it is the former, you can repeat the steps by narrowing down to the rest half of startup items, until you isolate the offender.

Here are the steps to perform a clean boot:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to bring up the Run box. Type or past **msconfig**  and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-1.jpg)
2. Click the **Services**  tab and tick the box for **Hide all Microsoft services** .

   * **If Resident Evil Village stops crashing** , you can try repeating these steps, disabling half of the services each time until you pinpoint the culpable program. Once you do, do some research on the internet to find out what the program is for, then contact the vendor of this program for advice or an alternative solution.  
   * **If Resident Evil Village still crashes** , please continue to **Fix 10** .

### Fix 10: **Reinstall Resident Evil Village and Steam**

 If you’ve exhausted the fixes above but the issue still sticks around, it is likley that the current version of Resident Evil Village or Steam installed on your PC is the culrpit. You should reinstall the game and the client, then check to see if you finally solve the woe.
