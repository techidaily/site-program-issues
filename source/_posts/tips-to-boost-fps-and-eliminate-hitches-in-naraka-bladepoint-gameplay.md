## 2\. Disable unnecessary programs

 Too many programs running in the background will most likely drain your system as they take up a certain amount of resources. To get a better gaming experience, you’re supposed to disable those programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Naraka: Bladepoint.

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo + R keys simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste**taskmgr** and press Enter to open the Task Manager.  

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)
3. Under the Processes tab, right-click the programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Naraka: Bladepoint and select**End task** .  
 (Be cautious that you should not end processes that are essential for running Windows, otherwise your computer may fail to work properly. )  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-programs-running-in-the-backgroundend-task.jpg)  

 After you’ve done these, play your game. If you’re still having sudden extreme framerate drops and stuttering during the gameplay, proceed to the next fix.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.

## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Famous graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to offer players a smooth gameplay. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4708689&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png" border="0">Epubor Audible Converter for Win： Download and convert Audible AAXC/AA/AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics driver

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 As described above, manually updating your graphics driver would require a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

3. Click**Update All** . Driver Easy will then download and update all your outdated and missing device drivers, giving you the latest version of each, direct from the device manufacturer.

## 5\. Verify integrity of game files

 When you’re having performance issues, verifying game files may work like magic. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files are intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or replace any corrupted files. To do this, follow the instructions below.

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-properties.jpg)
2. Select **LOCAL FILES** . Then click **Verify integrity of game files…** . Then wait for the process to complete.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/verify-integrity-of-game-files-1.png)  

 The verification process would take several minutes to finish. After that, play Naraka: Bladepoint to check if your problems have been solved. If you are still having these problems, proceed to the next fix.

## 6\. Disable overlays

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Click **Steam** from the sidebar and select **Settings** .
