### Bonus: Update your drivers

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**
