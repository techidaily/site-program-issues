### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 The constant freezing might indicate a driver issue. If your driver is updated it might cause the freezing issue. We suggest you should always keep your driver up to date for the best in-game performance.  
 Both NVIDIA and AMD have published the **New World compatible GPU driver** , you can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest correct installer, and installing it step-by-step.  
 But if you don’t have the time or patience to install manually, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

6. Restart your PC for the change to take effect.

If this fix doesn’t bring luck, take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Underclock your GPU core

 Many gamers overclock graphics cards for better performance. Usually, the higher you overclock your GPU, the more processing power you get. But for the New World freezing issue, underclocking your GPU core could be the solution.

 It sounds strange, but it works for some people and it’s worth trying.

1. [Download](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) MSI Afterburner.
2. Install MSI Afterburner.
3. Open the software and find your graphics card.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/msi-afterburner-featured.jpg)
4. Because of the different PC environments, you may need to keep adjusting the Core Clock until you’re no longer freezing.  

 Here we suggest underclocking your GPU Core Clock by 400 MHz and memory clock 500 MHz.
5. In MSI Afterburner, change your power limit to 80%.
6. Save the profile and relaunch New World to check.

If it’s still not working, try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Lower your graphics settings

 The freezing issue usually relates to the graphics settings, some players indicate after they capped their FPS and lower graphics settings, the freezing issue was gone.  
 Here’s how:

1. Open New World. On the top right corner, click the **gear icon** to open settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/new-world-change-graphics-1.jpg)
2. In the left pane, select **Visuals** . Then set **Max FPS** 60 fps.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cap.jpg)  
 In most cases, 60 fps is enough. But some gamer replies they’ve lower to 30 FPS.

3. Play New World to check.

 If changing graphics settings don’t give you luck, continue to the next fix below.
