## Q1: Is the source you’ve inputted exactly correct?

 Generally, the “Couldn’t retrieve directory information” error means**the source you’ve inputted can’t be found** . It could be simply because the source you’ve inputted is wrong, like there’s**typo** ,**extra space** in the URL.

 So when Kodi tells you the Unable to connect error, firstly **check the URL you’ve type or paste, make sure it’s exactly typed correctly.** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/kodi2.png)

Then add the source again.

 If you add the source successfully, so great. If you still see the error, don’t panic, you have something else to try…

### Method 2

 Many network connection problems could be due to the old, missing or corrupted network driver on your computer. You can solve it easily by**updating your network driver** . Whether you choose to update the network driver manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the Scan Now button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click Update. The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them – either manually through Windows or all automatically with **[Driver Easy Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Note: If your computer lose network connection, you can try the[**Offline Scan**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) feature of Driver Easy to update your network driver.

 Have you fix the problem? If yes, great! If the error still exists, don’t give up hope, move onto the next step.

## Q3: Does the source you want to add run properly?

 If you’ve ensured that you enter the URL correctly and the network connection is great, time to check if the source you added runs properly.

Follow to check the status the source you want to add:

1. Enter the source in your browser and press**Enter** .
2. If the source runs properly, you would see a page**containing a zip file** .

 If the source is down or offline, you would be prompted an error message saying:**This site can’t be reached.**

 If this is the case, we recommend **downloading other add-ons from the [official Kodi website](https://kodi.tv/addons) of your choice** .
