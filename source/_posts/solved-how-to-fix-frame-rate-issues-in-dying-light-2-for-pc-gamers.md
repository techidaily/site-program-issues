### Fix 2: Make sure your PC meets the system requirements of Madden 20

 Madden may also crash if your PC fails to meet its system requirements. So you should check your PC specs to see if it meets the system requirement for Madden 20.

**Minimum:**

| OS               | **64-bit Windows 7/8.1/10**                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Processor        | **FX-4330 (AMD) or i3-4350 (Intel)**          |
| Memory           | **8GB**                                       |
| Video card       | **Radeon RX 460 / GeForce GTX 660 or better** |
| DirectX          | **11 Compatible video card or equivalent**    |
| Hard-drive space | **48.5 GB**                                   |

**Recommended:**

| OS               | **64-bit Windows 10**                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Processor        | **FX-4330 (AMD) or i3-4350 (Intel)**           |
| Memory           | **8 GB**                                       |
| Video card       | **Radeon R9 270x / GeForce GTX 670 or better** |
| DirectX          | **12 Compatible video card or equivalent**     |
| Hard-drive space | **48.5GB**                                     |

 If you’re not sure whether your PC meets the system requirements for Madden 20 or not, just follow the instructions below to check the specs of your PC:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then type **dxdiag** and press **Enter** .
