Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

### Fix 3: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 Sometimes, antivirus software can interfere with game performance. Temporarily disabling your antivirus can help determine if it’s causing the problem. You can consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.

 If disabling your antivirus resolves the issue, consider contacting the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of game files

 Occasionally, game files can become corrupted or altered due to malware on your PC. If your game is crashing for no obvious reason, consider verifying the integrity of your game files through Steam.

**1)** Run Steam.
