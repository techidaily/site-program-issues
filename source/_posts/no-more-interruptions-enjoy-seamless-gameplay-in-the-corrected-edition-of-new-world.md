## God of War Gameplay Interruptions Solved? No More PC Crashes

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gow-featured.jpg)

 The PC port of God of War is finally here, which means you no longer need an expensive console to play Kratos. While the game seems to be optimized for PC, many gamers are still dealing with**constant crashes** , and some have to go through the same chapter over and over again.

 If you happen to be on the same boat, don’t worry. Here’re some fixes you can try.

 When you’re troubleshooting, be careful NOT to download third-party “patches” unless you know what you’re doing.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you find the one that gives you luck.

1. [**Verify the integrity of game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Disable in-game overlays**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Make sure Windows is up to date**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Increase the virtual memory of your PC**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [**Change in-game graphics settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
7. **[Check if your system is corrupted](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1:**Verify the integrity of game files**

 Before you do anything else, first**check if there’re any new patches** . It could be the cheapest and safest fix to begin with, and you can do that by verifying the game files.

Here’s how to verify game files on Steam:

1. Open your Steam client and go to**LIBRARY** . Right click**God of War** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gow-verify-1.jpg)
2. In the left pane, select**LOCAL FILES** . Then click**Verify integrity of game files** … and wait for the process to complete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gow-verify-2.jpg)

Once done, start God of War and check if the game crashes again.

If this doesn’t give you luck, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2:**Disable in-game overlays**

 In-game overlay is a feature that allows you to read stats and record achievements during gameplay. But according to some gamers it sometimes brings performance issues. So if you’re constantly crashing with God of War, make sure to disable in-game overlays by**Steam** ,**Discord** or**NVIDIA GeForce Experience** .

If you don’t know how, use these steps to disable Steam Overlay:

 After disabling all the overlays, restart your game and test the gameplay.

If this doesn’t fix the issue, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 3:**Update your graphics driver**

 In most cases, the constant crashes indicate that you’re using a**broken or outdated graphics driver** . Many players report that they stopped the crash after updating their graphics drivers, so you should definitely check if your drivers are up to date.

 Both AMD and NVIDIA had rolled out**day-0 driver updates** for God of War. See below for update instructions.

 You can update the GPU driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s websites ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) ), downloading the latest correct driver and installing step by step. But if you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can use[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to update drivers automatically.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 If the latest graphics driver doesn’t stop the crash, simply try the next fix below.

### Fix 4:**Make sure Windows is up to date**

 Windows could run into issues if it’s missing some important updates. Normally it’s an automated process, but you can also check for updates manually, especially when you’re on the buggy Windows 11.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**control update** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/run-control-update-1.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then check for available updates. (Or click Restart now if it prompts “Restart required”)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/run-control-update-2.jpg)

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your system and check if the problem persists.

 If this trick doesn’t do the trick for you, take a look at the next one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Increase the virtual memory of your PC

 There’re also players who fixed the issue by**increasing the virtual memory** of their systems. You can try the same and see how it goes. But still, consider an upgrade if you’re using 8GB for AAA titles — 16GB RAM has already become the minimum for decent gaming in 2022.

Here’s how to increase the virtual memory of Windows:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and type**advanced system settings** . Click**View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/search-advanced-system-settings.jpg)
2. Under the**Performance** section, click**Settings…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/system-advanced-performance-virtual-memory.jpg)
3. In the pop-up window, navigate to the**Advanced** tab. Under the**Virtual memory** section, click**Change…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-memory-advanced.jpg)
4. Deselect the **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** checkbox. Then select**Customize size** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/vritual-memory-set.jpg)
5. Enter**Initial size** and**Maximum size** according to the physical memory of your computer. Microsoft recommends that virtual memory should be 1.5 to 3 times the size of physical memory. In my case, the physical memory (actual RAM) of my computer is 8 GB, so the**Initial size** for me here is**8 x 1024 x 1.5 = 12288 MB** , and the**Maximum size** should be**8 x 1024 x 3 = 24576 MB** . Once you’ve entered your size of virtual memory, click**Set** , then click**OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-memory-set-02.jpg)
6. Restart your computer.

<a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Now you can check if you can make it through the crash location.

If God of War crashes at the same spot, you can try the next method.

### Fix 6: Change in-game display settings

 Though optimized, God of War still shows glitches at specific scenes. Some gamers found that the glitch disappeared after adjusting some graphics settings. You can do the same and see if that works for you.

1. Launch God of War and open**SETTINGS** . Select**Display** .
2. Set VSync to**Off** . If you’re on an AMD GPU, set**FidelityFX Super Resolution** to**Balanced** or**Performance** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gow-settings-1.jpg)
3. You can also lower the graphics settings according to your specs. Remember the point here is to check if the crash is graphics related.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gow-settings-2.jpg)

 If these tunings don’t seem to help, take a look at the next solution.

### Fix 7: Check if your system is corrupted
