5. If you already have the game installed on your SSD, just skip ahead to the next method below.

 If you’ve already had BMW installed on Steam, and you don’t want to install the game all over again, you can do the following to move the game to the SSD:

1. Launch the Steam client, and click**Steam** \>**Settings** on the top left corner.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/steam-settings.png)

 If installing Black Myth: Wukong on your SSD doesn’t help with the lags, stutters or frame rate dopping issues, please move on to the next method.

##  2\. Ensure your computer is not overheating

 If you’re playing BMW on a laptop, it’s possible that the cooling system is not powerful enough to keep your computer cool when the game is running. In that case, your laptop could get overheat, and Wukong will then suffer from frame rate drops and lags problems. To alleviate it, simply put your laptop on a stand, or better if you have a cooling pad.

 If you’re using a desktop, and you’re computer case is running hot, you may need to clean the dust and try an extra case fan.

 If this is not why Black Myth: Wukong lags, stutters, or has FPS dropping issues for you, please move on to the next method below.

## 3\. Optimize in-game settings

 The following in-game settings have proofed effective to the lagging, stuttering and frame rate dropping issues on our computers with different hardware components. Try them out to see if they work the charm for you:

1. Launch Black Myth: Wukong and hit the Esc button, then select**Settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bmw-settings-1.png)

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bmw-detaled-graphics-settings.png)
4. Note that you can also try to set**Visual Effect Quality** ,**Hair Quality** , and**Globa Illumination Quality** to**Low** instead, as they should help increase frame rates.
5. Then try the following settings for your display. You can also try 3840×2160 and 2160×1080 as the Display Resolution. Lower resolution usually helps to increase frame rates.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bmw-display-settings.png)
6. If you’re using an Nvidia 20 or 30 series GPU, you can try**FSR** for**Super Resolution Sampling** and turn off**Full Ray Tracing** .
