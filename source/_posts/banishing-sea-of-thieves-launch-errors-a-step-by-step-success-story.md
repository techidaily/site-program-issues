Tips: You can disable the alert in the launcher settings.

 **The solution is easy: update your driver – but not through Windows Update & Device Manager.**

 There’re**3 working ways** to update your driver to resolve the issue:

#### 1\. Through manufacturer’s app

 Some graphic card manufacturers provide apps to update their driver easily. Take NVIDIA for example, you can download the[NVIDIA GeForce experience app](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to update your NVIDIA drivers easily and quickly.

#### 2\. Through manufacturer’s official website

 If you don’t have such an app, you can go to the manufacturer’s official website and download the latest driver ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ), then install it manually.

#### 3\. Through Driver Easy

 If you don’t have the time to dig around on the internet, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.

## Fix 2: Launch with Vulkan

 There’s an easy fix that would help you run the game —**Launching the game with Vulkan instead of DX12** .

 If you’re not launching from Steam, the game should open a menu for you to select how to play the game (Vulkan or DX12).  
 Choose**Vulkan** and launch the game to check.

If you’re launching from Steam, move to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Verify game file

 If you launch the game from Steam, then you try to verify game files. This fix will let Steam check your local files. If there’re corrupted files, Steam will redownload them and replace them on your local install.

1. Launch Steam and go to**LIBRARY** .
2. Right-click on the game and select**Properties** .

3. Go to the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click**Verify integrity of game files…**

## Fix 4: Replace the launcher file

 Except for not launching, some players reported they can’t start the game when running on Proton and Manjaro. Replacing the launcher file may work for you.

1. Press the**Windows logo key + R** together to open the Run box.
2. Type**%appdata%** and press the**Enter** key.

3. Find and double-click the Evil Genius 2 folder.

4. Go to the Launcher folder to find the**Evil Genius 2.exe** file. Move the executable file into the**Bin folder** with evilgenius\_vulkan.exe.
5. Relaunch the game to check.
