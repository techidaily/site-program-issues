### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 Hardware problems can be caused by outdated or malfunctioning drivers. If the driver is outdated or wrong, it could cause problems like no sound and audio issues. So make sure your audio driver is up to date.

 You can update drivers manually by visiting the manufacturers’ official page and finding the most recent driver, then download and install it by yourself. Please note, you need to choose the one that suits your PC.

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
