##  1\. If you’re using Intel 13th, 14th Gen CPU…

 As warned by the game devs, Black Myth: Wukong may have the ‘out of video memory’ problem on an Intel 13th or 14th generation CPU (see more on the **[Intel CPU voltage bug](https://www.pcmag.com/news/intel-hints-13th-14th-gen-desktop-chip-bug-results-in-permanent-damage)**  if you’re interested). And they’re working on a solution to fix it. At this stage, here are some workarounds that you can try.

 If you’re not sure what CPU you have, check your Task Manager in this way:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-11.png)
2. Click the second icon (**Performance**), then select CPU, and you’ll see your CPU name there.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cpu-type.png)
3. Check to see if your CPU is listed here: **[Additional Warranty Updates on Intel Core 13th/14th Gen Desktop Processors](https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853#M75727)**

### Update the BIOS

 If you constantly see the ‘out of video memory’ error when playing Black Myth: Wukong, the first thing you do is to apply a**BIOS update** , or also called the**0x129 microcode update** . If you need help on how to do a BIOS update, here’s a post for your reference: **[How to Update BIOS in Windows 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** 

### Reduce CPU voltage

 If there’s no BIOS update for your Intel 13th or 14th Gen CPU just yet, you can try tuning tools like **[Intel Extreme Tuning Utility](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/17881/intel-extreme-tuning-utility-intel-xtu.html)**  (also referred to as Intel XTU) to**reduce your CPU voltage** . But please note that undervolting and underclocking your CPU could affect your gaming experience.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
###  Reduce Performance Core Ratio

 Another thing to try when there’s not yet a BIOS update for your motherboard: try to change the**Performance Core Ratio** to**54x, 53x** or even**52x** in Intel XTU to see if it helps. To do so:

1. Download and install Intel XTU, then launch it.
2. Go to**Advanced Tuning Section** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/intel-xtu-advanced.png)
3. Scroll down to **Per Core Tuning** , and change all Ratio Multipliers to**54x** . Then click**Apply** .

##  2\. Make sure your graphics card meets the minimum system requirement

 As the error message suggests, when you see the out of video memory problem in Black Myth: Wukong, one of the first things you do is to ensure that your graphics card meets the required system requirement for the game, which can be found on the[Steam page here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black%5FMyth%5FWukong/) .

To check your graphics card version:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time. Type **dxdiag** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/run-dxdiag.jpg)
2. Go to the **Display** tab, and you’ll see the name of your graphics card and other details about it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If your graphics card is older or below the required one, then you may need to consider upgrading to a more advanced one.

 If this is not the case, but you’re still seeing the out of video memory problem in BMW, please move on to the next method below.

##  3\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to the out of video memory problem in Black Myth: Wukong, so if the above methods don’t help to stop the error message, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. Intel and AMD have released the game-optimized version of the drivers, so you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

##  5\. Run the game with DirectX11

 According to some gamers, the workaround for the out of video memory problem in Black Myth: Wukong is to run the game with DirectX 11\. This could be because of the long-known issues between Unreal Engine and DirectX 12\. To do so:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### On Steam

1. Launch Steam.
2. In the **LIBRARY** , right-click Black Myth: Wukong and select **Properties**  from the drop-down menu.  
    
![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
3. Under the launch options, add **\-dx11** . Then save and try to launch Black Myth: Wukong to see if how it works.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
###  On Epic Games Launcher

1. Open the **Epic Games Launcher** .
2. In the top-right corner, click on the **initial of your Display Name**
3. Select **Settings** .
4. Scroll down and expand **Black Myth: Wukong** .
5. Check the box for **Additional Command Line Arguments** .
6. Type: –**d3d11**
7. Relaunch Black Myth: Wukong.

 If running Black Myth: Wukong in DirectX 11 still doesn’t help to fix the out of video memory problem, please move on to the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##  6\. Lower in-game graphics settings

 Other than running the game with DirectX 11, lowering the in-game graphics settings also helps to fix the out of video memory problem for some.

 This is probably because the error message only shows up when you’re running out of video memory, and lowering the in-game graphics settings reduces the v-ram used in-game, which helps to bypass the system memory limit. This is especially true if you have a 6GB or lower v-ram GPU.

 To see if this does the trick for you, try to lower the in-game graphics settings by adjusting the Black Myth: Wukong’s display properties, which should include adjusting a lot of texture quality settings to medium or low.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##  7\. Increase virtual memory

 Another common reason for memory problems like the out of video memory error in Black Myth: Wukong could be insufficient virtual RAM space. To see if this is your case, you can try to increase the virtual memory to allow more RAM resources for the game to run. To do so:

1. In the Search box, type **advanced system settings** . Then click **View advanced system settings**  from the list of results.  
    
![increase the page file size](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/advanced-system-settings.png)
2. Under the **Advanced**  tab, click **Settings** .

7. Microsoft recommends that the virtual memory you set is **no less than 1.5 times and no more than 3 times** the size of your RAM. To check RAM on Windows, follow the instructions below.
* On your keyboard, press **Windows + R keys** simultaneously to invoke the Run box.
* Type **msinfo32.exe** and press Enter.  
    
![check RAM](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/msinfor.exe_.png)
* Scroll down and look for the **Installed Physical Memory (RAM)** entry.

1 GB (Gigabyte) = 1000 MB (Megabyte)

 So in my case, the recommended initial size is: 8 GB \* 1000 \* 1.5 = 12000 MB

For the recommended maximum size, it will be: 8 GB \* 1000 \* 3 = 24000 MB

 After increasing the page file size, try to launch Black Myth: Wukong again to see if the out of video memory error remains.
