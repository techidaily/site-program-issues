4. Open the faulty game to see if it works properly. If yes, then great! If the error still pops up, move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2:**Verify Integrity of Game Files**

If any files are found different, they may be changed or repaired. This may help fix the error.

To verify the integrity of game files:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .

### Fix 4: Update your device drivers

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong or outdated device drivers. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes your problem.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.png)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Fix 5:**Run Steam as administrator**

Here is how to run Steam as administrator:

1. In your desktop, right-click on**your Steam shortcut** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s.png)
2. Click the**Compatibility** tab, then tick the**Run this program as an administrator** box. Finally, click**Apply** \>**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-4.png)
3. Re-launch Steam and the game.

4. Check if the Steam Fatal Error is fixed.

 Error still persists? Don’t worry. Here are a few more fixes for you to try.

### Fix 7: Check for an update

You can check Steam or the game in question to see if there’s a new update available. Once you make sure you’ve installed the latest update of Steam and the game, check to see if the fatal error is fixed.

### Fix 8: Reinstall Steam

 If you’ve exhausted all possible fixes but the error still happens, you can reinstall Steam as a last resort. Many players may fear this would delete all installed games, but you can easily save them by backing up the Steamapps folder – that way you wouldn’t need to redownload a single game after reinstalling Steam.

**To back up the Steamapps folder:**

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Windows-logo-key.jpg) and**E** at the same time to open File Explorer, then copy and paste**`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`** into the address bar and press**Enter** . This will open the installation directory of Steam.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-1.png)
2. In list of folders, locate the**Steamapps** folder. Then copy it into a different folder on your computer.
