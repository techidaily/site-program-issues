### Fix1: Update your graphics driver

 The _Indivisible_ crashing error is most likely to occur if you’re using the wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. So, try updating your graphics driver to see if it resolves your issue. There are two ways you can do this:

* [**Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating the driver. To get the latest correct driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**4)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

If the game still crashes, then try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Run _Indivisible_  as an administrator

 Windows runs programs in user mode by default. Under this mode, _Indivisible_ may fail to access certain game files and crashes. To see if that’s the core problem, try running your game as an administrator to give it high integrity access. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  If you’re running Steam now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Run as administrator** .

**3)** Click **Yes** .

**4)**  Relaunch _Indivisible_ from Steam.

If this didn’t fix your issue, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: End unnecessary background programs

 Another common cause of _Indivisible_ crashing issues is software conflicts. To keep your game running properly, close unnecessary programs during gameplay. Here is how to do it:

* **[If you’re on Windows 7…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[If you’re on Windows 8 or 10…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### If you’re on Windows 7…

**1)**  Right-click your taskbar and select **Start Task Manager** .

**3)** Right-click the process you want to end and select **End Process Tree** .

 Try launching _Indivisible_ to see if it works properly now. If your issue persists, check the next fix.

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of your game files

 The crashing issue on_Indivisible_ is probably triggered by a certain damaged or missing game files. In this case, try verifying the integrity of your game files on Steam. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-25-23.jpg)

**3)**  Right-click **Indivisible** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-25-31.jpg)

**4)** Click the **LOCAL FILES** tab, then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-25-45.jpg)

**5)** This could take several minutes. Wait for the process to be complete. (Steam will fix corrupted files if it detects any.) Then, relaunch your game to test your issue.

 If _Indivisible_ crashes again, then try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Set your PC power plan to High-Performance

 The power plan on all computers is set to Balanced by default. Your computer sometimes might slow down automatically to save energy and affect your game performance. If that’s the problem for you, you’ll need to change your power plan to High Performance. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **control** . Then, click **Control panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-25-55.jpg)

**2)** Under **View by,** click **Large icons** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-26-03.jpg)

**3)** Select **Power Options.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-26-10.jpg)

**4)** Select **High Performance** .

 Your computer will generate more heat under the High Performance mode.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-26-17.jpg)

**5)** Restart your computer and your game.

 This should fix the _Indivisible_ crashing. If it didn’t, move on to the fix below.

### Fix 6: Adjust your virtual memory

 If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files, your programs such as _Indivisible_ are likely to crash. Here is how to adjust the size of your virtual memory:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-26-27.jpg)

**2)** Click **View advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-26-36.jpg)

**3)** Click **Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-27-02.jpg)

**4)**  Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-27-10.jpg)

**5)** Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-27-19.jpg)

**6)** Click your **C drive** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-27-29.jpg)

**7)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

 Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-27-43.jpg)

**8)** Click **Set** , and then click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-27-57.jpg)

**9)** Restart your computer and your game.

 If _Indivisible_ is still unplayable, read on and check the fix below.

### Fix 7: Check for Windows updates

 If your game crashing unexpectedly and frequently, it’s unlikely that out-of-date Windows OS is the core problem, but you should still rule out the possibility. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-28-06.jpg)

**2)**  Click **Check for updates,**  and then wait for Windows to download and install the updates automatically.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-28-18.jpg)

 Restart your computer and_Indivisible_ after the update is finished. If the crashing issue happens again, try the fix, below.

### Fix 8: Reinstall the game

 If none of the fixes above worked for you, reinstalling the game is very likely the solution to your issue. To do this, open Steam, go to your game library, right-click the game and uninstall it.
