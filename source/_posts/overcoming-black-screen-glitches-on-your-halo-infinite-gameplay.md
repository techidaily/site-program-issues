## 2\. Update your graphics driver

## 3\. Delete temp files

## 4\. Disable background applications

 Games require a considerable amount of memory to function properly. If too many unwanted or unnecessary programs keep running in the background, there will be insufficient memory, which causes the freezing issue. To solve the problem, you can disable some background applications.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc keys** simultaneously to bring up the Task Manager.
2. From here, you can take a look at all the programs that are eating up your memory.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-Manager-Memory.png)
3. Locate the applications that are eating up a lot of memory. If you don’t need them while playing Halo Infinite, right-click each of them and select**End task** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If you use Razer Synapse, make sure you turn it off while playing Halo Infinite. Some players found that it affects your gameplay. It could be possible that Razer Synapse is in conflict with your game.

 If turning off background applications doesn’t do the trick, proceed to the next fix.

## 5\. Verify integrity of game files

 A variety of issues may be caused by corrupted game files, e.g. glitched graphics. If you encounter the freezing issue, verify the cache files of Halo Infinite, which can help ensure that the installation is up-to-date and if necessary, repair any bad or corrupted game data. Thus, this can help you rule out the cause of your problem and fix it.

To verify the integrity of your game files, follow the steps below:

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Under the**LIBRARY** section, right-click**Halo Infinite** and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-verified-1.jpg)
3. Select the**LOCAL FILES** tab. Then click**Verify integrity of game files…** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/verify-integrity-of-game-fiiles.png)

 Now Steam will verify your game’s files. This process may take several minutes. Once the process is completed, close the Window then launch your game. If it still keeps freezing, move on to the next fix.

## 6\. Uninstall Multiplayer High-Res Textures

 Another great way to improve Halo Infinite’s performance is to uninstall Multiplayer High-Res Textures. This may also give you a noticeable FPS boost. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Under the**LIBRARY** section, right-click**Halo Infinite** and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-verified-1.jpg)
3. Select the**DLC** tab. Then uncheck**Multiplayer High-Res Textures** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/disable-multiplayer-high-res-textures.png)

If this doesn’t help, try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Disable in-game overlay

 Halo Infinite’s in-game overlay is a feature that aims to improve your gaming experience. But sometimes they just do the opposite of that, eating up bandwidth or introducing compatibility problems. In this case, you’ll need to disable it. Follow the instructions below to do so.

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Under the**LIBRARY** section, right-click**Halo Infinite** and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-verified-1.jpg)
3. Select the**GENERAL** tab. Then uncheck**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/disable-in-game-overlay.png)

 Now relaunch your game and you should be able to play in rows without having the annoying freezing issue.

 However, if none of the methods listed above work for you, it’s high time you run a scan of your PC and check if you have **corrupted, malfunctioning, and missing Windows software files** , which will cause performance issues.
