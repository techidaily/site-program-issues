## Fix 1: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Dying Light release regular game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused this lag issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, just download and install it to see if it can fix the game lag issue; if there’s no patches available, or if the issue persists after you installed the latest patch, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

The outdated or broken graphics driver may also lag the game.

 As we all know, an outdated or corrupted graphics driver would trigger game crashing, stuttering (FPS dropping, or lagging) and even screen flickering issues. We always recommend gamers to keep their graphics drivers up to date so as to avoid such issues. The latest graphics driver will enhance your graphics card performance and unlock the full potential of your graphics card, which will give you an edge in PC video games.

 If you don’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.
