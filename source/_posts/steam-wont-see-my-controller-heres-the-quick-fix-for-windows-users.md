1. **[Restart your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: **Restart your computer**

 Sometimes a game can crash or stop responding because of a temporary issue that you can fix by restarting your device.

 If the Terraria crashing issue still exists after the reboot, then move on to the next fix, below.

### Fix 2: **Disable your antivirus temporarily**

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If_Terraria_ works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If this didn’t help in resolving your problem, try the fix below.

### Fix 3: **Run your game as an administrator**

 By default, Windows runs programs as a user, with limited permission to access system control. This means that_Terraria_ doesn’t have full access to all game files and folders on your computer.

 To see if that’s the core issue, try running your game as an administrator. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Exit Steam.

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon** on your desktop and select **Properties** .

**4)**  Relaunch Steam and_Terraria_ to test your issue.

 You can hopefully run the game without crashing now. If the problem still exists, then go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 4: **Update your graphics driver**

 One of the most common causes of the_Terraria_ crashing issue is a faulty or outdated graphics driver.

 You can update your device drivers manually, if you’re happy to do them one at a time. But this takes quite a while. Or you can update them all with just a couple of clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-201.png)
