## Fix 1: Force restart Snap Camera

 Always make sure to open Snap Camera prior to your webcam applications. The chances are that the application will keep running in the background even if you’ve closed it. So you can exit it using Task Manager:

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.
2. Right-click Snap Camera and select**End Task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/End-Task.jpg)
3. Also, right-click the application you’re using, and select**End task** to force close it. If you’re using web applications, you should exit your browsers as well.

1. Open Snap Camera.
2. Click the**Settings** icon on the upper right corner.

 If you’ve already allowed Snap Camera to access your camera but it keeps giving you the “No available camera input” error, don’t worry. You can follow the next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Update webcam and graphics drivers

 One thing that really matters to your webcam performance and Snap Camera stability is the graphics driver on your Windows PC. When you first download the app, you may notice:

System requirements for Snap Camera

 If the hardware meets the minimum requirements, but you haven’t updated the driver for your specific graphics card or your webcam, then you should give it a try.

There are two ways for you to update your graphics and webcam drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually –](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended) –](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1: Manually

 To update your webcam driver, you’ll need o go to your graphics or webcam manufacturer’s website and download the exact driver for your operating system, then manually install it step by step.

### Option 2: Automatically

 For some people, the process of updating graphics and webcam drivers can be really time-consuming and error-prone. If that’s the case with you, we highly recommend you to update with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a reliable driver updater tool.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your Xbox adapter driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_Update All_ ). Or if you just want to update your webcam driver for free, simply click the**Update** button next to it (it’s partly manual).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Driver-Easy.jpg)
4. Restart your computer for it to take full effect.

## Fix 5: Turn off VPN services

 Using a VPN (virtual private network) is prohibited while using Snapchat or Snap Camera, so it’s preferable to turn off the VPN if you’re using one.

 Using a VPN can also lead to a temporary network block. So be sure to disable it and log into Snap Camera again.

## Fix 6: Clean reinstall Snap Camera

 If these methods above fail to solve your Snap Camera no available camera-input issue, you can perform a clean reinstall. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** key to open the Run box.
2. Type**appwiz.cpl** in the box and press**Enter** .  
![how to uninstall an app](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/how-to-uninstall-an-app.png)
3. Right-click**Snap Camera** and select**Uninstall** .  
![uninstall snap camera](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Uninstall.jpg)
4. Clear the Recycle bin.
5. Download[Snap Camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/download/) again, and follow the on-screen instructions to install.
6. Once complete, restart your PC and launch your Snap Camera to see if the issue has been resolved by now.
