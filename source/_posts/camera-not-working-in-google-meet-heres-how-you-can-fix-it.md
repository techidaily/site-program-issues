## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down according to your situation.

1. **[Force restart Snap Camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Clear cache of Snap Camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Allow App permission](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update webcam drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

6. **[Clean reinstall Snap Camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Force restart Snap Camera

 Always make sure to open Snap Camera prior to your webcam applications. The chances are that the application will keep running in the background even if you’ve closed it. So you can exit it using Task Manager:

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.
2. Right-click Snap Camera and select**End Task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/End-Task.jpg)
3. Also, right-click the application you’re using, and select**End task** to force close it. If you’re using web applications, you should exit your browsers as well.
4. Launch Snap Camera again, then the application.

 Now you should be able to see Snap Camera as a selectable camera and get rid of the “**No available camera input** ” error. If unfortunately, restarting doesn’t do the trick, you can head on to our next fix.

## Fix 2: Clear cache of Snap Camera

 Just like the smartphone apps, you can clear cache and app usage easily on Snap Camera for PC. To fully clear all the cache and temporary files, you need to select all the boxes:

1. Open Snap Camera.

## Fix 4: Update webcam and graphics drivers

 One thing that really matters to your webcam performance and Snap Camera stability is the graphics driver on your Windows PC. When you first download the app, you may notice:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/system-requirements.jpg)

System requirements for Snap Camera

 If the hardware meets the minimum requirements, but you haven’t updated the driver for your specific graphics card or your webcam, then you should give it a try.

There are two ways for you to update your graphics and webcam drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually –](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended) –](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1: Manually

 To update your webcam driver, you’ll need o go to your graphics or webcam manufacturer’s website and download the exact driver for your operating system, then manually install it step by step.

### Option 2: Automatically

 For some people, the process of updating graphics and webcam drivers can be really time-consuming and error-prone. If that’s the case with you, we highly recommend you to update with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a reliable driver updater tool.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your Xbox adapter driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3.

Or if you just want to update your webcam driver for free, simply click the**Update** button next to it (it’s partly manual).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Driver-Easy.jpg)
4. Restart your computer for it to take full effect.

## Fix 5: Turn off VPN services

 Using a VPN (virtual private network) is prohibited while using Snapchat or Snap Camera, so it’s preferable to turn off the VPN if you’re using one.

 Using a VPN can also lead to a temporary network block. So be sure to disable it and log into Snap Camera again.

## Fix 6: Clean reinstall Snap Camera

 If these methods above fail to solve your Snap Camera no available camera-input issue, you can perform a clean reinstall. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** key to open the Run box.
2. Type**appwiz.cpl** in the box and press**Enter** .  
![how to uninstall an app](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/how-to-uninstall-an-app.png)
3. Right-click**Snap Camera** and select**Uninstall** .
