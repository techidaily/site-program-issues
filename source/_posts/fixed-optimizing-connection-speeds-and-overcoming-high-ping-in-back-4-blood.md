![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebfc398cd6b.jpg)

 While you’re browsing the Internet on your computer, your system starts freezing for a few seconds, then resumes normally and then again freezes. When you open Task Manager, it shows Google Chrome using a high percentage of your CPU. You may wonder how come Chrome is eating so much of your CPU — there’re many possible causes for Chrome high CPU usage, but there are also many possible solutions…

## Try these fixes

### Fix 2: Disable unnecessary extensions

 Chrome extensions are also known to cause Chrome high system resource usage, such as 100% CPU, memory or disk usage. If you’ve installed a number of Chrome extensions, they may be the culprit for Chrome high CPU usage. We recommend disabling or deleting them one by one. Then restart Chrome and see if Chrome high CPU usage is fixed.

1. Type`**chrome://extensions**` in the URL bar and press**Enter** to open the Chrome extension manager, where Chrome extensions are installed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bece0cbe3af4.png)
2. **Toggle off** all extensions to disable them.

3. Restart Chrome and test if the issue is fixed. If not, move on to Solution 3, below.
