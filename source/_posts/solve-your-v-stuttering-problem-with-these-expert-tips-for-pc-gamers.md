2. Type or paste **control firewall.cpl** and hit Enter.

## 6\. Uninstall and reinstall the game

 If none of the above methods work, you should consider uninstalling and reinstalling the game.

 After having the latest version of Starfield installed on your system, launch it and see if you can get into the gameplay.

 However, if you still have difficulty launching Starfield, try this last resort – run a full scan on your PC. Your issue may be**due to the corruption of your system files** .

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type **cmd** . Find Command Prompt from the list of results and right-click it. Then select **Run as administrator** .
2. Click **Yes**  when you receive a prompt.
3. Copy and paste the following commands in Command Prompt, then press Enter.  

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`
4. Wait until you see a message saying “The operation completed successfully.”
