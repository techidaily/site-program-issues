### Fix 1: Check your computer for viruses or malware

 Perhaps you’re having a connection issue with Origin because there is a virus or malware on your computer. They may change your Internet settings or corrupt your computer file so Origin can’t go online. You should run your antivirus software to scan your computer for viruses and malware.

 If this resolves your problem, great! But if not, there are still other fixes you can try…

### Fix 2: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Your firewall or antivirus software can sometimes cause interference to Origin so it can’t connect to the Internet. To see if that’s the case for you, temporarily disable your firewall and see if the problem remains. (You may need to consult your firewall documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If this resolves your problem, you can contact the vendor of your firewall and ask them for advice. Or you can install a different antivirus solution.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when you have disabled your firewall.

2. Open File Explorer (by pressing the**Windows logo key** and**E** on your keyboard)
3. Copy the**following address** to the address bar, then press**Enter** on your keyboard.
