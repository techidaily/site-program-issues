## Before we start

 Check the system requirements of Stray before digging into fixes. It happens that the game is freezing, lagging, or looks like a slideshow when your computer hardware fails to meet its minimum system requirements.

Here are the minimum and recommended system requirements for Stray:

#### Minimum requirements

| **Operating system** | Windows 10 64-bit                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**        | Intel Core i5-2300 \| AMD FX-6350                          |
| **Memory**           | 8 GB RAM                                                   |
| **Graphics**         | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 Ti, 2 GB \| AMD Radeon R7 360, 2 GB |
| **DirectX**          | Version 12                                                 |
| **Storage**          | 10 GB available space                                      |

#### Recommended requirements

| **Operating system** | Windows 10 64-bit                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**        | Intel Core i5-8400 \| AMD Ryzen 5 2600                   |
| **Memory**           | 8 GB RAM                                                 |
| **Graphics**         | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780, 3 GB \| AMD Radeon R9 290X, 4 GB |
| **DirectX**          | Version 12                                               |
| **Storage**          | 10 GB available space                                    |

 If your PC doesn’t suit the needs of the minimum requirements, try to update your hardware first. If you’re confident that your hardware rig fits the game perfectly, start troubleshooting the Stray not launching with the listing fixes.

## Fix 1**Run the game as an administrator**

 Whatever games you’re playing, it’d be best to run the game as an administrator. That’s because an administrator is usually considered authorized. Therefore, all the operations will get full support and maximum resources of the system. Let’s see how to run Stray as an administrator once-for-all:

1. Right-click the**Stray.exe file** on your computer and click**Properties** from the pop-up list.
2. Click**Compatibility** . Then check the box**Run this program as an administrator** , and click**Apply** and**OK** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-13_16-55-36.jpg)
3. Now you can launch the game in the way you normally do.

 Check if the game still has the launching or crashing problem. If this fix doesn’t work for you, try the next one.

## Fix 2 Update graphics driver

 Updating drivers should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong. Stray not launching woe is probably being caused by GPU driver problems. So you should update your drivers to see if things go better.

## Fix 3 Verify integrity of game files

 One of the possible causes of game launching issues is missing or corrupted game files. Luckily, many PC clients allow you to verify the integrity of game files through the library:

1. Open Steam and click**Library** .
2. Right-click**Stray** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/skywalker-saga-crash-1.jpg)
3. Select**LOCAL FILES** on the left and click**Verify integrity of game files…**  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214" border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/skywalker-saga-crash-2.jpg)

 Steam will run its program to verify the files of this game for you. Once done, exit the software client and launch it again. Have a test to see if the launching issue is gone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 4 Repair system files

 Problem system files (eg. missing or corrupt DLL) also can affect the smooth running of Stray as flawed game files. To figure it out, you might want to run a thorough and quick scan with **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Fortect has been offering system repair solutions for years. It can fix Windows errors, blue screen of death,**damaged DLLs** , freezing computers, OS recovery, and more. When it detects problematic system files, it removes and replaces them with new and authorized ones from its updated online database.

Here is how it works:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open it and run a free scan for your computer (approx. 5 minutes).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)
3. After the scan, check the generated summary and click**Start Repair** to start your fixing process (and you’ll need to pay for that).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-3.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 5 Disable overlay

 If you’re using overlay apps such as Discord or Xbox, try to disable them. Because it’s reported that these apps may conflict with Stray, leading to crashing or freezing. What’s more, some games have a problem pairing with Steam overlay. So disabling Steam overlay may also be a solution for you:

1. Open Steam client.
2. Navigate to the**Steam** \>**Settings** \>**In-game** tab.
3. Uncheck**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/stray-not-launching.jpg)
4. Relaunch Steam.

## Fix 6 Update DirectX

 DirectX 12 is listed as one of the system requirements for Stray. If you’re using a lower version, things may go wrong, and launching problems in Stray can happen. Follow the steps to check your DirectX version:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on the keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**dxdiag** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-21_11-49-42.jpg)
3. Check your DirectX version in the pop-up window.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-21_11-50-29.jpg)

 If DirectX 12 is equipped on your PC, you can continue to try[Fix 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 However, check the following guide to**update DirectX** if you’re using a lower version.

1. Type**check** in the Windows search box. Then click to open**Check for updates** .

## Fix 7 Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables

 The latest version of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables ensures that Stray and other PC games can run properly. Check your Microsoft Visual C++ version first:

1. Type**control** in the Windows search box. Open**Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-21_12-23-58.jpg)
2. Click**Programs** .

## Fix 8 Close background processes

 Stray not launching easily occurs when there are too many programs running in the background. That’s because few system resources are distributed to the game. To solve this, you can close unwanted processes and set the game with high priority:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/task-manager-1.jpg)
2. Choose the processes consuming too many resources, and then click**End task** .

3. Click the**Detail** tab. Right-click**Stray.exe** and set its priority to**High** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/game-stuttering-10.jpg)

Return to the game to check if the problem is solved.

## Fix 9 Update Windows

 Downloading and installing all available Windows updates is a common solution when encountering program issues. The reason is that the latest Windows components tend to fix bugs crippling the proper working of applications. Here is how to update Windows:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows logo key** and**I** to invoke Settings. Then click**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/setting-updatesecurity-1.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-21_12-02-24.jpg)

## Fix 10**Turn off firewall and antivirus temporarily**

 If none of the above methods work, give a shot to this one. Sometimes, your firewall or antivirus might work overly, resulting in slow or restricted data transfer. And it may hinder the Steam game. To figure out if the firewall or antivirus is the root cause, you can disable them temporarily:

 Be extra careful in using the Internet during this period as your PC security may be endangered. Remember to**re-enable** them after the game.

1. Type **defender firewall** in the Windows search bar. Then click **Windows Defender Firewall** from the Best match.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/firewall-1.jpg)
2. Click **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** .
