 Launch the game after the verifying process completed and see if HLL crashes again. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. The outdated or broken graphics driver often crashes the game.

 The graphics card manuafacturers like Nvidia and AMD keeps releasing new graphics drivers so that they can fix bugs in the previous versions of graphics drivers and enhance graphics performance for their products.

 Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can use[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 The HLL developers release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

## Fix 4: Disable Steam Overlay

 Although Overlays are handy, sometimes they may interfere with the game. According to some PC players, it seems that the Steam Overlay doesn’t pair well with HLL. Try disabling Steam Overlay for HLL and see if the game crashes again. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** .**right-click** on _Hell Let Loose_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Disable Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-Steam-Overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features like Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., ensure that you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Launch HLL and see if the game crashes. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 In order to get a better FPS, many players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card. However, overclocking often crashes the game.
