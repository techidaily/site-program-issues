## Bonus: Update your drivers

 To get a better gaming experience, it’s very important to keep your drivers updated. There are two ways you can download your graphics and sound card drivers.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-asus-aura-for-window-10/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download drivers from their official websites. Enter your model name to find the correct model and choose your specific flavor of Windows system (Window 10 64-bits or etc.) Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the Aura driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
