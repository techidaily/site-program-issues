### Fix 8: Add Ashen as an exception to your 3rd party antivirus software

 This issue may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Ashen.

 Since Ashen consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat and the game may not run as expected. You can try adding Ashen and the Epic Games Launcher as an exception to your third-party antivirus application.

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.
