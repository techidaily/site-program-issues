If the Cult of the Lamb continues to crash, try the next fix.

1. Type**cmd** in the Windows search bar and click**Run as administrator** .

3. Hit**Enter** on your keyboard. Then wait for it to run a scan and repair bad sectors for your drive.

## Fix 6 Repair system files

## Fix 7 Add the game to whitelist

 Sometimes antivirus may overprotect your computer by blocking some data transfer which is essential for video games, causing games to crash or freeze.

 If you’re using any antivirus, these tools may have a negative impact on your gaming experience. To eliminate their effect, you can add the game to your antivirus whitelist. If you don’t know how to do it, just google your antivirus’s name and whitelist (eg. McAfee whitelist). Then follow the official guidelines to add Cult of the Lamb to its white list.

## Fix 8 Disable overlay

 It’s reported that some overlay apps may conflict with Cult of the Lamb, producing a crashing or freezing screen. If you’re using overlay software such as Discord or Xbox, disable them temporarily. In addition, some games have a problem pairing with the Steam overlay, so also disable the overlay on Steam with the steps below:

1. Open Steam client.
2. Navigate to the **Steam**  \> **Settings**  \> **In-game** tab.
3. Uncheck **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/stray-not-launching.jpg)

 Relaunch Steam after you have disabled apps and Steam overlay. Open the game to see if the problem is gone.
