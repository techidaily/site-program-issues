## 4\. Update your audio drivers

 For most Windows audio-related issues, your corrupt or outdated audio driver is the chief culprit. Using outdated drivers may lead to incompatibility issues, causing your THX Spatial Audio to malfunction. Therefore, you need to update each of your audio driver in order to get THX Spatial Audio to work.

 To update your audio drivers, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or directly go to the sound card manufacturer’s websites to download and install the latest drivers. If you’re using any Razer devices, you would also need to update all of your headset’s drivers. Obviously, this is pretty time-consuming.

 If you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers on your own, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do the busy work for you. It’s a useful tool that**automatically** recognizes your system and finds the correct drivers for it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation. No charges will occur until after your 7-day trial period ends.)

4. After updating, restart your computer to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 When the update completes, restart your computer. Then play supported content to check for changes.

## 5\. Perform a system restore

 After everything else, you can restore your system to a point from before THX Spatial Audio was acting up. It’s possible that the issue you’re having was facilitated by a change that your system has gone through recently which you cannot pinpoint.

 System Restore is a Windows feature that can help fix certain types of computer problems. Therefore, when things go awry, you can perform a system restore. Here’s how you can do this.

1. In the search box, type**restore** . Then click**Create a restore point** from the results.

 However, if none of the solutions listed above gives you any luck, you may need to check if there are any missing or corrupted system files. You can use the System File Checker tool (sfc /scannow) to look for any critical system issues, but most of the time it only scans major files and may miss minor issues.

 In this case, you would need to use a more powerful tool to repair your system, and we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It is an advanced PC repair tool that scans your PC, detects the issue, and solves them automatically, without losing any of your data.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Run the software. Fortect will start a deep scan of your system. The process may take a while.
3. Once the scan is finished, you’ll see a complete overview of your system and issues. Click**Start Repair** to start the repair process and wait for Fortect to fix the problem.
