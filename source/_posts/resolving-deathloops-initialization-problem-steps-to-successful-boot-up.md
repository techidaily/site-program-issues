## Fix 1: Update your driver

 I believe you would be familiar with this warning message after a couple of hours of playing. Some players won’t be affected, but for others, this warning message points out the reason for the game not launching or crashing issue.

Tips: You can disable the alert in the launcher settings.

 **The solution is easy: update your driver – but not through Windows Update & Device Manager.**

 There’re**3 working ways** to update your driver to resolve the issue:

#### 1\. Through manufacturer’s app

 Some graphic card manufacturers provide apps to update their driver easily. Take NVIDIA for example, you can download the[NVIDIA GeForce experience app](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to update your NVIDIA drivers easily and quickly.

#### 2\. Through manufacturer’s official website

 If you don’t have such an app, you can go to the manufacturer’s official website and download the latest driver ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ), then install it manually.

#### 3\. Through Driver Easy

 If you don’t have the time to dig around on the internet, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## Fix 2: Launch with Vulkan

 There’s an easy fix that would help you run the game —**Launching the game with Vulkan instead of DX12** .

 If you’re not launching from Steam, the game should open a menu for you to select how to play the game (Vulkan or DX12).  
 Choose**Vulkan** and launch the game to check.

If you’re launching from Steam, move to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Verify game file

 If you launch the game from Steam, then you try to verify game files. This fix will let Steam check your local files. If there’re corrupted files, Steam will redownload them and replace them on your local install.

1. Launch Steam and go to**LIBRARY** .
2. Right-click on the game and select**Properties** .

3. Go to the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click**Verify integrity of game files…**

4. Reboot the game when the process is finished.

If this fix is not working, move to the next one.

## Fix 4: Replace the launcher file

 Except for not launching, some players reported they can’t start the game when running on Proton and Manjaro. Replacing the launcher file may work for you.

1. Press the**Windows logo key + R** together to open the Run box.
2. Type**%appdata%** and press the**Enter** key.
