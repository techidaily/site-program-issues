<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Now you can check if your GeForce overlay is working.

If the overlay is still no function, check out the next fix below.

## Fix 5: Run GeForce Experience as an administrator

 To be able to access all files GeForce Experience needs to run properly, you’ll need to have administrator permissions. This might help you solve the problem of GeForce overlay not working. Here’s how:

1. On your desktop, right-click GeForce Experience and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/geforce-experience-properties.jpg)
2. Navigate to the**Compatibility** tab, check the box of**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**Apply** to save changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Check if the GeForce overlay not functioning issue still occurs.

If the issue persists, go ahead with the next fix below.

## Fix 6: Enable experimental features

 Enabling experimental features in GeForce Experience allows you to access updates and features that haven’t been released to all users. Try this solution to see if the GeForce overlay not working issue persists. Here’s how:

1. Open GeForce Experience, then click the gear icon to open**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/geforce-setting.jpg)
2. In the left panel, select**GENERAL** . Under the ABOUT section, tick the box next to “**Enable experimental features** . A GeForce Experience update may be required.”.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/enable-experimental-feature.jpg)

Once done, check if your GeForce overlay is working.

If not, move on to the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 7: Disable third-party services

 Sometimes the third-party services may prevent GeForce overlay from working properly. Try temporarily disabling them to see if your GeForce overlay works or not. If GeForce overlay starts working again, try to enable third-party services one at a time to figure out the problematic services. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** to open System Configuration.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/msconfig.jpg)
3. In System Configuration, navigate to the**Services** tab, check the box of**Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hide-all-microsoft-services.jpg)
4. **Uncheck** all the services EXCEPT NVIDIA services, then click**OK** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/uncheck-services.jpg)
5. Restart your computer.
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940312&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After the computer completely reboots, check if your GeForce overlay is working. If it starts working now, you’ll need to re-enable services one by one in System Configuration until you find the problematic one. Then restart your computer to apply the changes.

If this method doesn’t do the trick, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 8: Repair Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

 The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages basically make sure some programs work and function properly without experiencing conflicts. If these redistributables are corrupt, it may lead to your GeForce overlay not working. You can follow the steps below to fix this issue:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/appwiz.cpl_-1.jpg)
3. In Programs and Features, right-click**Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable** and select**Change** . (You need to repeat the same process for all the listed Visual C++ Redistributable packages, but you can skip 2008 and older versions.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/change-microsoft-visual.jpg)
4. In the pop-up window, click**Repair** . Then wait a few minutes for the repairing process to finish.

## Fix 9: Install a Media Feature Pack

 If you’re a Windows 10 N user, you can try installing a Media Feature Pack to fix the GeForce overlay not working issue, since Media-related features are largely absent from Windows 10 N versions.

 To ensure this method works properly, you need to fully update your graphics drivers first. If you haven’t already done so, go back to[Fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to do it now.

1. Go to the[Microsoft Download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack) for Media Feature Pack.
2. Under Downloads,**select the appropriate edition** of Windows 10 N from the drop-down menu, then click**Confirm** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/download-media-feature-pack.jpg)
3. According to your Windows edition, click**32-bit Download** or**64-bit Download** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/64-bit-download.jpg)
4. After downloading the pack, follow the on-screen instructions to install it.
