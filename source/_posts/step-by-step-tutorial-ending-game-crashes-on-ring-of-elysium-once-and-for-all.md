## Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Forza Horizon 5 releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch Forza Horizon 5 to see if the FPS is back to normal. If the in-game FPS still drops, or there are no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Update your graphics driver

 If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, you should update or reinstall the driver, because the outdated or faulty graphics driver may be causing Forza Horizon 5 FPS dropping issue.

There are mainly two methods for you to update the graphics driver:

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

## Set the Power Plan of your PC for high performance

 On Windows OS, a power plan is a set of system and hardware settings to manage how your computer consumes and conserves power. Generally speaking, the higher the performance, the more power your computer consumes.

 In most cases, the power plan on PCs are configured to **Balanced** by default, which may limits the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU. In Windows 10 or Windows 11, you can customize the power plan on your PC, which allows you gain more performance.

 If you’re experiencing peformance issues like FPS dropping, try modifying the Power Plan of your PC for Best Performance. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .  
![run dialog - powercfg.cpl](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png)
2. In the pop-up window, expand **Hide additional plans** and select **High performance** .

![control panel power options](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png)

 Launch Forza Horizon 5 and check if you get a better PFS. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Optimize in-game graphics settings

 Optimizing the graphics settings is another fix that may boost the in-game FPS, especially if your PC barely meets the minimum system requirements of Forza Horizon 5\. If you have a powerful PC, just skip this fix.

 Normally, the in-game PFS will increase after you lower some in-game graphics settings:

* Turn off **Night Shadows**
* Set **Shadow Quality** to Low
* Turn off **MSAA**
* Turn off **FXAA**
* Set **Reflection Quality** to Low
* Set **World Car Level of Detail** to Low

If the FPS in Forza Horizon 5 still drops, try the next fix, below.

## Modify graphics card settings

 If you haven’t tried this fix, just tweak your graphics card settings in Nvidia or AMD control panel to see if the in-game FPS boosts. Some players fix this issue after modified theire graphics card settings.

**For Nvidia users** , follow the steps below:

1. **Right-click** on your desktop and select **NVIDIA Control Panel** from the context menu.
2. Click **Manage 3D Settings** on the left, then navigate to the **Program Settings** tab. In the **Select a program to customize:**  part, add **Forza Horizon 5** from the program list.
3. In the **Specify the settings for this program** section, modify following settings:  

 Image Sharpening : **Off**  
 Threaded Optimization : **On**  
 Power Management : **Prefer Maximum Performance**  
 Low Latency Mode : **Off**  
 Vertical sync : **Off**  
 Texture filtering – Quality : **Performance**
4. Click **Apply** to save the changes.

**For AMD users** , follow the steps below:

1. Open **AMD Radeon Settings** .
2. Go to **Gaming** **\>** **Global Settings** . Then modify the settings the same way you see on the screenshot below.  
![AMD Radeon Settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AMD-Radeon-Settings.jpg)

 Run Forza Horizon 5 to check if the in-game FPS increases. If not, move on to the next fix, below.

## Disable overlays

 According to some PC gamers, overlays sometimes they may interfere with Forza Horizon 5 and even introduces performance issues and compatibility issues.

 Some players has reported that disabling the in-game overlay would improve the FPS in Forza Horizon 5\. If you’re using the in-game overlay, just disable it to see if the in-game FPS improves.

 There’re many apps that support overlay features. Here I’ll take the Steam Overlay as an example to show you how to turn the in-game overlay off in Steam:

1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **LIBRARY** , then right click on Forza Horizon 5 game title and click **Properties…** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. In the **GENERAL** section, Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .

![Disable the Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-the-Steam-Overlay-It-Takes-Two.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features, such as Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Run Forza Horizon 5 again after you disabled all the in-game overlays and check if Forza Horizon 5 fps drops. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Disable background recording and Xbox Game Bar

 For those who love sharing game highlight videos, the background recording and Xbox Game Bar feature in Windows 10 is convenient. However, once enabled, they’ll constantly run in the background, hogging a ton of resources.

 If you’ve turned on background recording and Xbox Game Bar, and you’re suffering from in-game FPS drops, just try disabling them. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **I** at the same time to open **Windows Settings** . Click **Gaming** to open Windows 10 gaming settings.  
![Windows 10 settings gaming](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Windows-10-settings-gaming.jpg)
2. **Turn off** the toggle under **Xbox Game Bar** if it is turned on.  
![Turn off Xbox Game Bar](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Turn-off-Xbox-Game-Bar.jpg)
