Even though it’s quite optimized on PC, Black Myth: Wukong still has some bugs and issues to fix on certain PC hardware device combinations. Other than the Intel 13th and 14th CPU problems ([read more here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2358720/discussions/0/6149189044492760562/)), some gamers also notice random crashing, freezing, and even black screens during or even at the very beginning of the game.

6. **[Repair system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

##  1\. If you’re using Intel 13th or 14th Gen CPU

 Before we move further, it should be clarified that Black Myth: Wukong might not be the one to blame for the crashes, freezes, and black screen issues in-game: as warned by the game devs, Intel 13th or 14th Gen CPU users may face error messages, instability, and crashes due to the recently revealed Intel CPU bug.

 Unfortunately, there hasn’t been an absolute fix from Intel, but other gamers and the devs propose some workarounds, including updating your BIOS, undervolting and underclocking your CPU, and reducing the performance core ratio.

 See this post for more detailed instructions on how to do them: **[Black Myth Wukong Out of Video Memory Error on PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** 

 If this is not your case, please move on to the other methods below regarding the crashing, freezing and black screen issues in Black Myth: Wukong.

##  2\. Clean reinstall your display card driver

 Another very common reason for game crashes and freezes is an outdated or faulty graphics card driver, and Black Myth: Wukong is no exception. In this case, it’s recommended that you do a clean reinstallation of the display card driver, to avoid problems from shader caches.

 To do so, DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) is usually recommended, as it can do a pretty good job removing all the older or faulty display driver files on your computer. To do a clean reinstallation of the display card driver with DDU:

1. Download DDU from the[**official download page**](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) . Then unzip the folder, and double-click the**DDU** file to further extract the execution file.

2. Boot your computer into Safe Mode as instructed here:[**Start Safe Mode using the System Configuration tool**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. When in Safe Mode, go to the folder where you unzip the DDU execution file. Double-click to run**Display Driver Uninstaller** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-2.png)
4. Select **GPU** and **your GPU manufacturer** on the right side. Then click **Clean and restart** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-1.png)
5. Your computer should restart when the old driver files for your graphics card are cleaned.
6. Restart your computer afterward. Your computer will now have the generic display card driver provided by Windows.

 Now it’s time to update your display card driver. Game Science recommends different approaches for different brands.

 For**AMD** graphics card users, you should install an older driver, the AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition **[24.5.1](https://www.amd.com/zh-cn/support/downloads/previous-drivers.html/graphics/radeon-rx/radeon-rx-7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx.html)**  , with driver version 23.40.33.01 for Windows 10 and Windows 11, and Windows driver store version 31.0.24033.1003.

 For**Intel** and**Nvidia** graphics card users, you should use the latest versions of the drivers available.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-49.png)

 Then run Black Myth: Wukong again and see if it still crashes, freezes and has black screen. If the problem still remains, please move on to the next fix below.

## 6\. Repair system files

 If you are facing persistent issues with Black Myth: Wukong and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial.

 The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.
