### Method 2: Use a wire connection

 Itâ€™s recommended to use an ethernet connection instead of WIFI. Although WIFI is convenient to use, itâ€™s less stable than a wire connection, especially for online gaming.

**Tip** : Stop downloading other files while hosting with your friends to play Outriders.

 If youâ€™re already using an ethernet connection, please to move to the next fix.

### Method 3: Update your drivers

 The game has had graphic driver issues in the past that would show performance worsen. On the other hand, network driver would affect your internet connection. Therefore we recommend to update your graphic driver and network adapter driver.

 You can manually update these drivers by going to the manufacturerâ€™s official websites, but thereâ€™s an easier way â€” use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to automatically update your drivers.

 Thatâ€™s it, hope it helps. The issue mostly relates to the game servers so thereâ€™s not much we can do. Hope the lagging issue would be fixed at launch.
