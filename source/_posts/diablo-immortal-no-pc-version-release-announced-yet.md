![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/diablo-immortal-featured.jpg)

 Diablo Immortal is finally on PC. But this first original release didn’t work out so well, and many PC gamers are reporting a**not launching/crashing at startup** issue. If you happen to be on the same boat, don’t worry. Here’re some proven tips you can try.

## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all. Simply work down the fixes until you find the one that does the charm.

1. [**Verify the integrity of game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Perform a clean boot**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Increase your virtual memory**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Reinstall Diablo Immortal**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [**Check if your system is corrupted**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 You can expect the new game to be a little buggy. Though the developers are rolling out nightly updates, before you try anything more complicated, you should first**do a scan and repair** to check if the game files are corrupted or outdated.

1. Open the**Battle.net** launcher and select**Diablo Immortal** .
2. Click the**gear icon** next to the**Play** button. Then select**Scan and Repair** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/diablo-immortal-scan-repair.jpg)
3. Wait for the process to complete. Once done, click**Play** and see if you can launch the game now.

 If this fix doesn’t work for you, take a look at the next one below.

### Fix 2:**Perform a clean boot**

 According to some gamers, Diablo Immortal won’t launch when there’s a**software conflict** . Given we all use our PCs differently, the quickest way to find out is to perform a clean boot. This will start Windows with only the necessary system services and programs.

 Also make sure to**disable overclocking software** like MSI Afterburner and**turn off any kind of overlays** : Discord, GeForce Experience, etc.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-clean-boot-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .

3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your hardware manufacturers, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA** ,**Logitech** and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to apply the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-disable-services-except-gpu-audio.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Esc**  at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the **Startup**  tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/task-manager-startup.jpg)
5. One at a time, select any programs you suspect might be interfering, and click **Disable** .

6. Restart your PC.

 Once your PC restarts, only the essential programs and services will start. You can now launch Diablo Immortal and check if it crashes again. If not, you can try to root out the culpable program or service. A way to do that is to repeat the steps above, but **disable half of the services and programs** .

If Diablo Immortal is still not starting, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, you’re actually looking at a**driver issue** . New games may have trouble launching when you’re using a broken or outdated graphics driver. So if you don’t remember when was the last time you updated your GPU driver, definitely do it now.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website, downloading the latest correct installer and installing step by step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to do that manually, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to update automatically:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 4: Increase your virtual memory

 Though Diablo Immortal is by no means a demanding game, it could be a problem if your rig has only 8 GB RAM or less. If it’s a memory issue, you can give a temporary boost by increasing the virtual memory.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **advanced system settings** . Click **View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/search-advanced-system-settings.jpg)
2. Under the **Performance**  section, click **Settings…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Advanced**  tab. Under the **Virtual memory** section, click **Change…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-memory-advanced.jpg)
4. Deselect the **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** checkbox. Then select **Customize size** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/vritual-memory-set.jpg)
5. Enter **Initial size** and **Maximum size** according to the physical memory of your computer. Microsoft recommends that virtual memory should be 1.5 to 3 times the size of physical memory. In my case, the physical memory (actual RAM) of my computer is 8 GB, so the **Initial size** for me here is **8 x 1024 x 1.5 = 12288 MB** , and the **Maximum size** should be **8 x 1024 x 3 = 24576 MB** . Once you’ve entered your size of virtual memory, click **Set** , then click **OK**  to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-memory-set-02.jpg)
6. Restart your computer and check if you can start the game.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If you’re sure it’s not a memory issue, simply continue to the next fix.

### Fix 5:**Reinstall Diablo Immortal**

 Some players reported that they work around this issue by reinstalling the game. As Diablo Immortal is much smaller than COD: Warzone, you can try the same and see how it goes. In the meantime, you may also want to[do a clean reinstallation of the Battle.net](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) client.
