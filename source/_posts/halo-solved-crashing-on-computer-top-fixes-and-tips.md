### Before getting started

 Halo 3 could be crashing because you’re running it beyond your computer’s abilities. So make sure your computer meets the requirements for the game.

| OS                | Windows 7 x64-based                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| CPU               | Intel Core i7-975 \| AMD A 12-9800 APU |
| GPU               | GeForce GTS 450 \| Radeon R7 Graphics  |
| Storage           | 55 GB available                        |
| Screen resolution | 1920\*1080                             |

_Halo 3 Minimum System Requirements_

 If your computer meets these requirements but still Halo 3 doesn’t launch properly, try the methods below.

## Fix 1: Stop apps from running in the background

 Generally, the game crashes because it’s running out of memory or overheating. So to save data usage and system resources, you can stop some apps from running in the background by following these steps:

 1) On the left end of the taskbar, click the**Start** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Start-icon.jpg) icon and then click**Settings** .

## Fix 3: Update your video card drivers

 A range of gaming problems such as crashing and freezing is caused by a wrong, faulty, or outdated graphics driver. Halo 3 is no exception. To enjoy smooth gameplay, you should always keep your graphics driver up to date.

 You can search for the latest graphics driver from your graphics card’s manufacturer [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and then manually install it. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

Here’s how to update your drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee.

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard to open the Run box.

 2) Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .

 Then click**Hide all Microsoft services** and click**Disable all** .

## Fix 5: Run Halo 3 as an administrator

 If you’ve tried all the fixes above and still haven’t resolved the Halo 3 crashing issue, then you should try running the game as an administrator.

 1) Right-click the**Halo 3** icon on your desktop and select**Properties** .  
  
![open as an administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-Properties.jpg)
  

 2) Click the**Compatibility** tab and click**Run this program as an administrator** . Click**Apply** and**OK** .  
  
![run as administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-compatability.jpg)
  

 3) Go to the directory where you installed Halo 3, and run the**.exe** file as administrator as well.  
  
 4) Relaunch Halo 3.  
  
 If the problem still persists, then try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Install the latest game patch

 When a new game is released, there are still many bugs in it. And those bugs might cause the game crash issues. So developers keep updating the games to fix the bugs and improve the gaming performance.  
  
 So if there is a patch available, download and install it, then run the game again to check if the problem is solved. If it isn’t, or there is no new patch available, then move on to Fix 7.

---

## Fix 7: Verify the integrity of game files

 Halo 3 is available on PC through Steam. But players have been experiencing sudden crashes in Halo 3 on Steam. It can be caused by a bad game cache, so you need to ensure that the integrity of game files is intact.  
  
 1) Run Steam  
  
 2) Click the**LIBRARY** tab.  
  
![verify integrity of game files on Steam; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
  
 3) Right-click**Halo 3** and select**Properties** .  
  
![verify integrity of game files; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
  

 4) Under the**LOCAL FILES** tab, click**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE…** .
