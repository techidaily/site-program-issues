### Fix 1: Meet the minimum system requirements

 The minimum computer specs need to be met to run Arma 3 properly. Here are the minimum requirements to play _Arma 3_ :

| **OS:**           | Windows 7 SP1 (64bit)                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Memory:**       | 4 GB RAM                                                                             |
| **Graphics:**     | NVIDIA GeForce 9800GT / AMD Radeon HD 5670 / Intel HD Graphics 4000 with 512 MB VRAM |
| **DirectX:**      | 10                                                                                   |
| **Storage** **:** | 32 GB free space                                                                     |

 If you’re running an especially old version of Windows, or your graphics card is a couple of generations too far back, then you’ve probably found your problem. In this case, you’ll need to play the game on another computer.

 If you’re not so familiar with installed hardware on your PC, follow the instructions below to check them:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the_Arma 3_ crashing issue is an outdated graphics driver. To keep your game running correctly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct graphics driver at all times.

There are two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating the driver. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 5: Change your PC power plan

 By default, the power plan on all computers is set to Balanced to save energy. So, your computer sometimes will slow down automatically and cause Arma 3 crashing issue.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **control** . Then, click **Control panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-737.png)
