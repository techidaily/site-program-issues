## Fix 1 Allow access to your microphone

 If your computer doesnâ€™t grant access to the use of a microphone, no app will be able to capture your voice. In other words, you need to allow your system and application to access your microphone.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to invoke Settings. Select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working1.jpg)
2. Scroll down and click**Microphone** . Click the**Change** button, then make sure the**Microphone for this device** is toggled**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working7.jpg)
3. Check if**Allow apps to access your microphone** is**On** .
