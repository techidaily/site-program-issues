![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/civ-6-bot-launching-featured.jpg)

 Looks like the recent update of[Civilization VI](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vi?epic%5Fcreator%5Fid=28725b529b5346a38a080b6a920aa97a&epic%5Fgame%5Fid=cd14dcaa4f3443f19f7169a980559c62) didn‚Äôt go so well, and many gamers start reporting a**game not launching** issue. But annoying as the problem may be, it might not be so hard to fix.

## Try these fixes

 We‚Äôve gathered the latest working fixes for your Civ 6 not launching issue. Simply work your way down until you find the one that gives you luck.

1. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 If you have trouble updating the game, you might just need a simple reboot.

### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 You can‚Äôt expect your game to work fine if there‚Äôre files missing or broken. So first you need to**run a scan of your game folder** .

Here‚Äôs how to do it on the Epic Games client:

1. Open your Epic Games client and go to**Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/epic-1-2.jpg)
2. Click the**ellipses** at the bottom right corner of Sid Meier‚Äôs Civilization VI. Then select**Verify** and wait for the process to complete.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 It‚Äôs very likely that your game won‚Äôt run when you‚Äôre using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . If you‚Äôre an avid gamer, you should always keep your drivers up to date so as to avoid compatibility and performance issues.

 You can update your drivers manually if you‚Äôre a tech savvy user: you need to go to the manufacturer‚Äôs website, then search, download and install the driver step by step. If you‚Äôre not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can leave it to**Driver Easy** . It‚Äôs a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your computer and check if Civ 6 works now.

 If the latest graphics driver doesn‚Äôt do the charm, you can check out the next fix.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 Civ 6 has been out for several years now, so it‚Äôs possible it‚Äôll run into compatibility issues with the latest Windows 10\. Microsoft releases system updates for Windows 10 on a regular basis. It‚Äôs important to**make sure you install all the system updates** .

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To confirm you‚Äôve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up to date‚Äù when you click **Check for updates** .

 Once you‚Äôve installed all the system updates, check if you can get Civ 6 working now.

If this solution doesn‚Äôt help, you can continue to the next one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Perform a clean boot

 Given we all have different desktop environments, the cause of the issue could be**interfering programs** . If you‚Äôre not sure, do a clean boot to rule out this possibility.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-clean-boot-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your hardware manufacturers, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA** ,**Logitech** and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to apply the changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-disable-services-except-gpu-audio.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Esc**  at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the **Startup**  tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/task-manager-startup.jpg)
5. One at a time, select any programs you suspect might be interfering, and click **Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/task-manager-startup-disable-startup-program.jpg)
6. Restart your PC.

 Now you can try to launch Civ 6\. If it‚Äôs working this time, repeat these steps and disable only half of the services and programs to root out the offenders.

If a clean boot doesn‚Äôt help, you can check out the next fix.

### Fix 5: Install the latest Visual C++ redistributable

 Some gamers reported that**installing the latest Visual C++ redistributable package** fixes the issue, so you can try the same and see how it goes.

1. Go to the support page of Microsoft. Under the**Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 section** , click**vc\_redist.x64.exe** and download the installer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/latest-c.jpg)
2. Open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 You can also uninstall all the Visual C++ redistributable in**Programs and Features** , then reinstall them one by one. Be sure to choose the latest 64-bit installer.

### Fix 6: Switch your DirectX version

 According to some,**running Civ 6 on another version of DirectX** might be a potential fix. Normally you‚Äôre prompted to select the DirectX version at startup. But you can also use the .exe file directly. By default, you can the .exe files in _C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Sid Meier‚Äôs Civilization VI\\Base\\Binaries\\Win64Steam_ . Use_CivilizationVI\_DX12.exe_ for DirectX 12 and_CivilizationVI.exe_ for DirectX 11.
