 This problem can also be caused by the**hardware issue** . So you can try to troubleshoot the hardware and solve the problem.

### 1\. Put your PS4 in an open space

 The PS4 freezing issue can possibly because of an**overheating problem** . If the PS4 doesn’t have enough space for the air to cool download the fan, it may be overheated and stuck in.

 If that’s the case, you can try to**put your PS4 in an open space** to have more gas around it, so your PS4 is allowed to have**better air circulation** . Additionally, you may need to regularly**clean the dust** on your PS4 to have it under maintenance.

### 2\. Check all the cables and ports to be plugged correctly

 Sometimes the cables lose when connecting can also result in this problem. You can try to **check if all the cables are correctly and tightly plugged in your PS4** and other equipment.

### 3\. Upgrade the hard drive

 When you are using your PS4 to play games or to modify the settings, the data will be read and recorded by your hard drive. So if there is something wrong with your hard drive, your PS4 can get stuck or lagged when using your PS4.

 The hard drive faulty can also cause PS4 freezing. If there is something wrong with your PS4 HDD, you can try to**upgrade your hard drive to solve the problem** .

 2)**Replace** the hard drive disc with the new upgraded hard drive disc.
