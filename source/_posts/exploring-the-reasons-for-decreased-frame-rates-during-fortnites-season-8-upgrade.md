### **Check If your PC meets the minimum system requirements for Fortnite**

 Fortnite FPS may drop if your PC fails to meet the minimum hardware requirements of the game. Check if your PC meets its minimum hardware requirements first:

* **The minimum system requirements for Fortnite:**

| **Operating System:** | Windows 10 64-bit or Mac OS Mojave 10.14.6 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Processor:**        | Core i3-3225 3.3 GHz                       |
| **Memory:**           | 8 GB RAM                                   |
| **Graphics Card:**    | Intel HD 4000 on PC; AMD Radeon Vega 8     |

 As we all know, it’s never the ideal way to play Fortnite with a PC that just meets its minimum hardware requirements. So we also list the recommended system requirements for Fortnite below.

* **The recommended system requirements for Fortnite:**

| **Operating System:** | Windows 10/11 64-bit                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:**        | Core i5-7300U 3.5 GHz, AMD Ryzen 3 3300U, or equivalent |
| **Memory:**           | 16 GB RAM or higher                                     |
| **Graphics Card:**    | Nvidia GTX 960, AMD R9 280, or equivalent DX11 GPU      |
| **Video Memory:**     | 2 GB VRAM                                               |

### **Update your graphics driver**

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel constantly release new graphics drivers to fix bugs and improve the gaming performance and experience.

 If the graphics driver on your PC is outdated or corrupted, you may not be able to enjoy the optimal gaming experience, and sometimes you may run into the Fortnite FPS drops issue.

 **To fix this issue, the first thing you should do is update your graphics driver.** There are two ways that you can update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Driver-Easy-Scan-screen.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. You need the Pro version of Driver Easy to do this, so you’ll be prompted to upgrade.  

 Don’t worry; it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you don’t like it you can get a full refund, no questions asked.  
![update drivers](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6.png)  

 (Alternatively, if you’re comfortable manually installing drivers, you can click ‘Update’ next to each flagged device in the free version to automatically download the correct driver. Once it’s downloaded, you can manually install it.)

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### **Check your Internet connection speed**

 If your Internet connection speed is too slow, the network latency will also cause Fortnite FPS drop issue. Follow the instructions below to test your Internet connection speed:

1. Click **[here](http://www.speedtest.net/)**  to access the official website of SPEEDTEST.
2. Click **GO**  to begin testing your connection speed.
