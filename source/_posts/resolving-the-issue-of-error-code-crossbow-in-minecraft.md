### Fix 1: Update Minecraft to the latest version

 Generally, game developers will keep releasing new editions to fix the known bugs and add new content for the game. So, when you encounter the error code: Crossbow, the very first thing is to update Minecraft to the latest version. This should happen automatically when your device is connected to the Internet. But if it doesn’t, you can update Minecraft manually. Here’s how:

**For Windows 10**

1. In the search box of your taskbar, type**store** , then click**Microsoft Store** from the list of results.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/microsoft-store.jpg)
2. Click the**three dots** in the top right corner and then click**Downloads and updates** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/downloads-updates.jpg)
3. Click**Get updates** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Then the Microsoft store will check and install all the latest updates for your applications, including Minecraft.

**For other devices** , you can check this[official instruction page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/updates/instructions) .

 After updating, try to sign back into your Minecraft account and see if the error code: Crossbow appears again.

If the issue remains, there are other fixes below you can try.

### Fix 2: Try to sign in repeatedly

 The error code: Crossbow may happen due to an overcrowded server or a glitch in Microsoft’s sign-in system. To fix it, you can try to sign in repeatedly. Although this method sounds a little stupid, it does work for many players.

 This time the problem should be resolved. But if it doesn’t, try the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Update your network driver

 If you’re using a faulty or outdated network driver, you may encounter many problems when playing online games, like the Error code: Crossbow in Minecraft. To see if that’s the case for you, you should make sure your network driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit the motherboard manufacturer’s website and search for your model, then download and install the network driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/61604.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 5: Change your DNS settings

3. Right-click your network adapter and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ethernet-properties.jpg)
4. Select**Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IPv4.jpg)
5. Select**Use the following DNS server addresses** . Then enter**8.8.8.8** for**Preferred DNS server** and**8.8.4.4** for**Alternate DNS server** , and click**OK** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/8844.jpg)
6. Restart your computer and try to sign in to Minecraft again.

If this method doesn’t do the job, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 6: Use a VPN

 VPN is short for Virtual Private Networking. It can protect your privacy and improve your network when you’re surfing the Internet. So during rush hours, you can**try using a VPN to gain a better Internet connection** , which may help you fix the Minecraft login error. If you’re not sure which VPN to choose, we recommend **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and **[Cyberghost VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . ( _Note: Avoid using free VPNs, since they rarely resolve your issues but could bring many problems._ )

 You can check out the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy Coupon site](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for juicy VPN deals. Basically, they all have a money-back guarantee.

### Fix 7: Reinstall Minecraft
