## Fix 2: Verify the game files integrity

 If your game files are missing or corrupted in a previous installation, it could lead to the not launching issue. The good news is you can check for it easily on the Steam client, here’s how:

1. Open your Steam library and find Monster Hunter: Wings of Ruin. Right-click the game icon then click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/steam-rightclick-properties.jpeg)
2. Under the**LOCAL FILES** tab, click**Verify integrity of game files** .

4. Once the repair is complete, restart the Steam client and launch the game.

## Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin could fail to launch when your graphics driver is faulty or outdated. You may want to check if your graphics driver is up-to-date and functioning properly.

 One way to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date is to manually update it[via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . If Windows suggests your driver is up-to-date, you can still check if there’s a newer version and update it in Device Manager. Go to the manufacturer’s website, and search for the latest correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [INTEL](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [Asus](https://www.asus.com/support/Download-Center/)

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact video card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your PC for the new driver to take effect. If your game still won’t launch after you updated your graphics driver, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Check for third-party software interference

 Third-party software could interfere with the Steam client. If your game isn’t launching, you may need to look for running programs that may be conflicting. Here are some common applications that have been reported to cause interference: antivirus software, VPN, download accelerator, web server applications, anti-spyware program, file-sharing**software, and IP filtering programs** .

 If you close a certain app and find the game launches normally, then you know the app you turned off was the problem. Remember to keep the problem software off when you want to play Wings of Ruin, or find an alternative to this software. Also you could contact the supplier of the problem software for support.

 If you still can’t launch Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, try the next fix.

## Fix 5: Perform a clean boot

 Sometimes, background programs, Windows services, or startup items could cause the not launching issue for Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin. In this case, you can try to perform a clean boot.

 A clean boot will start your PC with the minimum sets of drivers and services that Windows requires to run. By doing a clean boot, you can identify if there’s any background program interfering with Wings of Ruin.

**Here’s how to perform a clean boot:**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)
2. Under the**Services** tab, check**Hide all Microsoft services** , then click**Disable all** and**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-40-15.jpg)
3. Switch to the**Startup** tab, click**Open Task Manager** .  
 (Windows 7 users: right-click anywhere empty on your taskbar to find the option of task manager.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-45-12.jpg)
4. Under**Startup** tab, click each startup item then click**Disable** until you’ve disabled all startup items.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467" border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-48-33.jpg)
5. Restart your PC.

 If MHS2: Wings of Ruin still won’t start, jump to[fix 6](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) below.

 If MHS2: Wings of Ruin now starts, this means at least one of the programs you disabled was causing the problem.  
  
**Here’s how to find out which one(s):**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)
2. Under the**Services** tab, tick the**Hide all Microsoft services** checkbox**,** then tick the checkboxes in front of**the first five items** in the list.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Then click**Apply** and**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-53-16.jpg)
3. Reboot your computer and launch Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin. If it once again won’t launch, then you know that one of the services you ticked above is conflicting with it. If it_does_ launch, then the above five services are fine, and you’ll have to keep looking for the offending service.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above until you find the service that conflicts with MH2: Wings of Ruin.  

 NOTE: We recommend testing five items in a group since it’s more efficient, but you’re welcome to do it at your own pace.

 If you don’t find any problematic services, you’ll need to test the startup items.**Here’s how:**

1. Right-click anywhere empty on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-29-08.jpg)
2. Switch to the**Startup** tab, and**enable the first five startup items** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-59-36.jpg)
3. Reboot and try launching MHS2: Wings of Ruin.
4. Repeat until you find the startup item that’s conflicting with the game.
5. Disable the problem program and reboot your PC.

## Fix 6: Install the latest Windows updates

 Although less likely, if your system is outdated, a new game like Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin could fail to launch. Since Windows Update releases new updates now and then, you need to make sure that you always install the available updates. Here’s how:

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
 (If you don’t see the search bar, click the Start button and you’ll find it in the pop-up menu.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will scan for any available updates. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll get a**You’re up to date** sign. You could also click**View all optional updates** and install them if needed.
