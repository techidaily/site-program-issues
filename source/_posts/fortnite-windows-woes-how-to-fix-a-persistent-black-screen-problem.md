### 1\. Disable in-game Overlay

 Overlays sometimes eat up bandwidth or introduce compatibility problems, thus causing problems in games, and that includes Resident Evil Village not launching or crashing on start up.

 Turning off in-game overlay has been proved helpful by many Resident Evil Village players. If you’re using apps with overlay features, just disable every single one of them such as Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Steam, etc.

#### Disabling Discord Overlay

1. Launch the Discord app.
2. Click the **Settings** icon, and then select the **Overlay** tab.
3. Toggle the switch to disable the **Enable in-game overlay** option.

#### Other common overlay applications

* AMD Radeon ReLive
* Nvidia Shadowplay/Share
* Overwolf
* Razer Synapse Stats
* Razer Cortex Gamecaster
* Xbox Game DVR
* Twitch
* Plays TV

 Check if you’re having other common overlay applications installed and learn how to disable them. Once they’re disabled, you can launch your game and test the issue. If Resident Evil Village is still not launching, you can try the fix below.

### 2\. Update to the latest Game Ready driver

 Both Nvidia and AMD’s newly released game-ready driver provides optimal support for Resident Evil Village. So if you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, make sure you do so before trying other fixes.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* [**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
