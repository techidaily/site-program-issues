5. **[Adjust the graphics settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Reinstall the game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

Check if the game runs normally now. If not, move on to the second fix.

### Fix 2 – Verify the integrity of your game files

 Star Wars Squadrons crashing may be caused by missing or corrupted game files. So an integrity check is necessary at the very start. We’ll show you how to do this both on **[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and **[Origin](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### If you’re playing on Steam

**1)** Launch the Steam client, and navigate to the**Library** tab.

**2)** Right-click**Star Wars Squadrons** from the game list and click**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-3.jpg)

 Wait for the repair process to finish. Then launch the game to see how it works. If crashing persists, try **[Fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to update your GPU driver.

#### If you’re playing on Origin

**1)** Launch Origin and select**My Game Library** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0.jpg)

 Relaunch the game after repair finishes. If crashing remains, try the next fix below.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Game crashes are usually driver-related and can indicate a wrong, faulty or outdated graphics driver. To keep Star Wars Squadrons running smoothly and boost the game’s performance, you should update your graphics driver to the latest.

There are mainly two ways you can do the driver update:

**Option 1 – Manually** – You can search for the most recent graphics driver on your GPU manufacturer’s websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  . Then download the driver corresponding with your Windows version, and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
