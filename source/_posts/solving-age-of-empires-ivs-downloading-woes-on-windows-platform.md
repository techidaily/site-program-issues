## Resolving Slowdowns in Dota 2? Expert Tips for a Seamless Play, Updated

Delays and lags in-game are no doubt ruining the fun of the game. If that’s a problem for you when you’re playing Dota 2 and you want to fix Dota 2 lag during gameplay, you’re in the right place.

## Try these fixes

 There’re 2 types of lag relevant to gaming – one is FPS lag, the other is network lag. If you’re experience the FPS lag, usually you can adjust your graphics settings to fix it. If you’re experiencing network lag instead – your network connection has slowed down, you can check for bandwidth-hungry apps and your network settings.

 Here’re some know fixes for the Dota 2 lagging issue. You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[End unwanted background programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Rule out driver issues](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Configure in-game video settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Change your PC’s power plan](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Adjust the proxy settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. **[Clear Steam cache and cookies](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: End unwanted background programs

 Lags might occur if you’re running multiple applications on your computer, hogging network resources. If that’s the case for you, follow the instructions below to check for and turn off them:

**4)** Relaunch Dota 2 to see if this has resolved your problem.

If not, don’t worry. There are still 5 more fixes to try.

### Fix 2: Rule out driver issues

 One of the most common causes of lags during gameplay is the faulty or incompatible graphics driver. If Dota 2 starts lagging after you updated the graphics driver, you’ll need to **[roll back the driver to the previous version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ; if you haven’t made any changes to the driver, then **[try updating it to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Roll back your graphics driver to the previous version

 To roll back your graphics driver to the previous version, follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.

**2)** Enter**devmgmt.msc** , then hit the**Enter** key.

 If this didn’t help, then move on and try **[Fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Update your graphics driver

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-358.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
