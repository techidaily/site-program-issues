 5) Restart your computer after the uninstall of both of your video card driver and your sound card driver.

 6) Going forward, you need to update your video and sound card driver.

**Manual drivers update** – You can update your drivers manually bu going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct drivers. Note that if you are a laptop users, you should go to the laptop manufacturer for the correct video driver, since drivers from chipset manufacturer or video card manufacturer might not include the customized features you need for you laptop.

## 4: Disable or uninstall third-party antivirus programs

 If you’ve installed antivirus or anti-malware programs such as Norton, Kaspersky, AVG, Avast Behavior Shield or Malwarebytes, you should **temporarily**   turn them off or disable them to see if they’re causing your Start menu not working problem. If your computer’s Start menu returns to normal when they’re off, you should contact the vendor of the software to see if they can provide some help.

 Note that Microsoft has its own default anti-malware, **Windows Defender** . It’s automatically enabled even if you also have other antivirus applications installed. Even if you disable your other antivirus programs, Windows Defender is always there for you during that certain time range. So, no need to worry too much about temporarily turning antivirus off.

 6: Run Microsoft Start menu troubleshooter

 Clearly, Microsoft has recognized the Start menu not working problem after the Creators update, therefore they have rolled out the [**Microsoft Start menu troubleshooter**](http://aka.ms/diag%5FStartMenu) for you to try.

 It will check if the Start Menu and Cortana are installed correctly, and whether registry key permissions and database corruptions are in place and more stuff like these.

 Install this troubleshooter and see if your problem can be fixed by it. If the problem remains, you should move on to the methods coming up next.

 7: Check and repair Windows files

 At times, your not working Start menu should be the result of corrupted system files. Luckily, you can easily get it fixed by running two built-in system tools. Here is what you need to do:

 1) Right-click the task bar on your desktop at the bottom and click **Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a3b3b34111eb.png)

 2) On the top of the Task Manager window, select**File** option and then choose**Run new task** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a3b8999a1831.png)

 3) Then type **powershell**  and t  ick the box for**Create this task with administrative privileges** . Click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a3b8a563ff80.png)

 4) Type**sfc /scannow** in and press the**Enter** key on your keyboard. Wait for a while for the process to complete.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a3b9c44015d6.png)

 If the result you see is the same with the screen shot above, your system files are all right, and you should move on and run another test. 5) Copy and paste the following command in, and press the Enter key on your keyboard. Still, it could take a while, wait with patience.

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a3b9c8a8bb33.png)

6) When these two tests finishes, check if your Start menu is back.

 1) Right-click the task bar on your desktop at the bottom and click **Task Manager** .

Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

 4) There, your Cortana is reinstalled, and your Start menu should also be back now.
