## Fix 2: Enable virtualization

 Virtualization technology allows multiple operating systems to run on one physical PC. Since we’re trying to run an Android emulator on a Windows PC, it’s essential to enable virtualization which could improve the performance of Nox Player.

 First you can check if virtualization is already enabled on your PC. If not, you’ll need to enable it in BIOS.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Check if virtualization is turned on

1. Run Nox Player. On the top-right corner, click the**three-line icon** and select**System info** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nox-system-info.jpg)
2. Look for**CPU VT** . If it’s already on, you can jump to[fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . If not, you’ll need to enter BIOS to enable it.

### Enable virtualization in BIOS

1. Click**Start** \>>**Power** . Hold down the**shift key** and click**Restart** at the same time. This will completely shut down your PC before it reboots.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shut-down-pc.jpg)
2. When your PC restarts and shows the manufacturer logo,**hold down the BIOS hotkey** until you enter BIOS setup.  
 The hotkey is usually**F1, F2, F12, Del or Esc** depending on different models. If you’re not sure which one works on your PC, consult the manufacturer manual or search online.
3. Find the virtualization setting in BIOS. The layout can also differ on motherboards, so you may see different terms. Look for**Virtual, Virtualization, VT-X, or SVM** .
4. **Enable** virtualization, then**save and exit** .

 NOTE: Sometimes even if you have virtualization enabled, Nox Player would still crash. One extra step you can do is to turn off Hyper-V, which is a Windows feature that may cause interference when virtualization is enabled.

**Disable Hyper-V**

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**appwiz.cpl** , then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/run-appwiz-cpl.jpg)
3. On the left panel, click**Turn Windows features on or off** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-14_12-09-45.jpg)
4. **Untick the boxes of Hyper-V related settings** , then click**OK** .

 You can test if the crashing issue returns. If it persists and you’re not using any antivirus tools, jump to[fix 4](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . If you have installed antivirus on your PC, follow the steps below.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Configure your antivirus software

 For antivirus, you also need to make sure it’s not blocking Nox. You can**add Nox Player to the whitelist** and then test the issue again.

 In addition, many antivirus software requires hardware-assisted virtualization for additional protection. As we mentioned above, virtualization is also essential for Nox Player. When both programs run at the same time, they may conflict with each other. In this case, you’ll need to**turn off hardware-assisted virtualization for your antivirus** .

 Below is a list of tutorials to configure settings for a few popular antivirus tools:

* [Avast](https://www.bignox.com/blog/solutions-for-avast-slow-down-noxplayer/)
* [AVG](https://www.bignox.com/blog/solutions-for-avg-antivirus-slow-down-noxplayer/)
* [Kaspersky](https://www.bignox.com/blog/solutions-for-kaspersky-slow-down-noxplayer/)
* [Norton](https://www.bignox.com/blog/solutions-for-norton-antivirus-slow-down-noxplayer/)
* [ESET NOD](https://www.bignox.com/blog/solutions-for-eset-nod-antivirus-slow-down-noxplayer/)
* [McAfee](https://www.bignox.com/blog/solutions-for-mcafee-antivirus-slow-down-noxplayer/)

 You can disable your antivirus temporarily if you want to test if the antivirus software itself is causing the interference,. Be extra cautious since browsing the web when your PC isn’t under protection can be risky.

 If your antivirus program does seem to cause the problem, contact the supplier for further assistance.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 4: Disable overlays

 Many programs such as Twitch and Zoom have an overlay feature, which is quite handy. However, overlays could cause performance issues for other programs, including emulators and games. If your Nox Player keeps crashing while you have overlays turned on, make sure to disable them and test the issue.

If this doesn’t solve your problem, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 5: Update your graphics driver

 An outdated or faulty graphics driver can cause game performance issues and affect emulators. You may want to make sure yours is up-to-date and functioning properly.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it[via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . If Windows doesn’t have the latest version available, you can search on the manufacturer’s website. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [INTEL](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [Asus](https://www.asus.com/support/Download-Center/)

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

## Fix 6: Increase virtual memory size on your PC

 Insufficient virtual memory (paging file) size can be a reason that Nox Player keeps crashing. Increasing virtual memory on your PC may help with the problem, so you can configure as needed. Here’s how:

### Check the paging file size on your PC

1. Press the**Window key** and**R** to invoke the Run box.
2. Type in**sysdm.cpl** and click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Increase virtual memory size

 If you want to increase the virtual memory size to fix the Nox crashing issue, you can manually allocate the paging file size:

1. Untick the checkbox of**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** , then select**Custom size** . It’s suggested to set your paging file size between 1.5 times and 3 times your RAM.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-14_15-27-33.jpg)
2. If you don’t know how much RAM you have, first, press the**Windows key** and**R** to invoke the Run box. Then, type in**msinfo32** and hit**OK** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/run-msinfo32.jpg)
3. In the pop-up window, look for**Installed Physical Memory (RAM)** .
4. Once you know how much RAM you have, use the following formula to calculate the values you should fill in:  

_**1GB = 1024 MB**_  
 _**Initial size (MB) = 1.5 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_  
_**Maximum size (MB) = 3 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_
5. For example, I have 8 GB RAM, so I should set the initial size as 8\*1024\*1.5=12,288 MB, and my maximum size would be 8\*1024\*3=24576 MB. Click**Set** and**OK** to save the changes.

## Fix 7: Change Nox Player settings

 If you’ve tried the fixes above but nothing worked, consider adjusting the settings of Nox Player. You may have to sacrifice a little graphics quality, but it should help improve the stability of the emulator and hopefully stop it from crashing. Here’s how:

1. Launch Nox Player. Click the**gear icon** on the top-right corner to open system settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-14_15-55-49.jpg)
2. In the**Performance settings** , you can try switching between the**graphics rendering modes** to see which brings better performance. Also**lower the resolution** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-14_15-58-25.jpg)
3. Under**Game settings** ,**lower your FPS** . You can tweak around to see what FPS value can best balance stability and performance, but we don’t recommend going below 40 as the graphics quality might suffer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-14_16-18-57.jpg)
4. Save the changes and restart Nox Player.

 If this doesn’t fix your problem, we have one more fix you can try.

## Fix 8: Update/reinstall Nox Player

 One last thing you can try is to update the Nox Player or reinstall the whole program. Using the new versions can fix known bugs and will likely reduce crashes. By clicking the**three-line icon** on the top-right corner, you’ll be able to**check for update** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-14_16-20-28.jpg)

 To do a clean reinstall, make sure you delete the Nox Player as well as all the local files and cache before you reinstall the app.
