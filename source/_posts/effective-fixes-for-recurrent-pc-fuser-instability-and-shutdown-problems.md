## Fix 5: Close CPU / memory hogging applications

 Another common cause of SnowRunner crashes is insufficient memory. If there’re lots of applications running in the background at the same time, your computer may run out of RAM and the game may crash.

1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift** and **Esc** at the same time to open **Task Manager** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open Task Manager.
2. Select any other applications and programs that take up a large amount of **CPU** or **memory** , then click **End task** to close it.

 If SnowRunner works well after you closed those CPU / memory hogging applications, congratulations!

 To prevent SnowRunner from crashing due to insufficient memory in the future, you may need to consider upgrading the memory (RAM) on your computer.

## Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 The clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to manually disable startups and services so that you can **find out the problematic program that crashes the game** . Once you locate the program, just uninstall it, and then the this issue will be solved. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.
