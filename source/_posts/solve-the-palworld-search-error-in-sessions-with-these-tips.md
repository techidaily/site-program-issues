## Install the latest game patch

 The developer of WRC 10 FIA World Rally Championship releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam or Epic Games Launcher, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch WRC 10 again to check if the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Some 3rd party antivirus software would interfere with the game files, which may also crash the game.

 Try adding both the game folder and Steam (or Epic Games Launcher if you play the game on the Epic platform ) as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable your 3rd party antivirus software before playing.

 Run WRC 10 and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

 If the game crashing issue persists, try the next fix to perform a clean boot.

## Perform a clean boot

 If there is a certain application conflicting with WRC 10, the game would not run properly. To find out the problematic application behind the game crashing issue, you need to perform a clean boot. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.

![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration5.png)

**Restart** your PC and launch WRC 10 to check if the game crashes again. If not, you need to open the **System Configuration** window again to enable services and applications **one by one** until you find the problematic software.

 After enabling each services, you need to restart your PC to apply the changes.

 Once you find out the problematic software that crashes WRC 10, you need to **uninstall** it to avoid game crashing issues in the future.

 If the game still crashes after you disabled all the 3rd party apps and services, try reinstalling WRC 10\. Normally, after reinstalling the game, you’ll be able to fix the crashing issue.
