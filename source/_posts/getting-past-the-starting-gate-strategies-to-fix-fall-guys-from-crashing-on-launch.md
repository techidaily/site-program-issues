### Fix 5: Disable your antivirus program

 Running Dauntless consumes lots of memory and CPU usage, so it’s possible that your antivirus program may detect it as some sort of threat and prevent it from running smoothly. So you might need to disable your antivirus temporarily and check if the crashing issue persists.

 If the antivirus program is the cause of the problem, you can add Dauntless to the program’s list of exclusions to bypass the issue.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

 Dauntless still crashes? Don’t worry, you have one more fix to try.
