Check if you can get past the checking for updates screen.

If the issue remains, try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Scan and repair your game files

 If your game files are missing or corrupted, you’re likely to encounter many issues when playing Microsoft Flight Simulator. To see if that’s the case, you can scan and repair your game files via Steam or Windows. Here’s how:

#### Steam

1. Go to your Steam**Library** .
2. Right-click**Microsoft Flight Simulator** and select**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MFS-properties.jpg)
3. Select the **Local files** tab then click the **Verify integrity of game files…** button.![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-Verify-integrity-of-game-files.png)

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 Microsoft constantly releases Windows updates to fix the latest bugs and add new features. To improve the performance of your device, you should ensure that your operating system is fully updated. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Window logo key** . Then type**check for updates** . Click**Check for updates** from the list of results.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/win11-search-bar-check-for-updates.jpg)
2. Under Windows Update, click**Check for updates** . Windows will automatically download and install the available updates.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Check-for-updates-button-1.jpg)

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your computer and Microsoft Flight Simulator to test if the game loads normally.

 If you still get stuck on the checking for updates screen, check out the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your network driver

 If you’re having trouble loading Microsoft Flight Simulator, you may encounter a connectivity issue. The connection error could be caused by a faulty or outdated network driver. To fix the issue, you need to make sure you’re using the latest network driver.

 One way to do that is to visit the motherboard manufacturer’s website and search for your model, then download and install the network driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your network adapter, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/scan-18.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/de-wifi6.jpg)

 Once you’ve updated your network driver, restart your PC and Microsoft Flight Simulator to see if you can get past the checking for updates screen.

 If updating your network driver doesn’t do the trick, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Move the community folder

 The Microsoft Flight Simulator scans the Official and Community folders every time you click Play or Launch. The bigger the Official and Community folders are, the longer the loading times are likely to be. Depending on your system this process can take up to several minutes. To reduce loading screens, you can delete the package folders of the mods and official aircraft you’re not planning to use regularly or move your community package to another folder. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to open**File Explorer** . In the search bar, type the following address to locate the Community Folder.  

**Microsoft Store version** : C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.FlightSimulator\_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalCache\\Packages  

**Steam version** :  
 AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft Flight Simulator\\Packages  

**Retail disc version** :  
 C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\MSFSPackages)  

**NOTE** : If you have installed the packages on a different drive than C: you’ll need to look inside your custom installation folder instead.
2. Right-click the**Community Folder** and select**Cut** .
3. **Paste** the Community Folder on your desktop or a drive of your choice.

 Restart Microsoft Flight Simulator to see if you can get past the checking for updates screen.

If the problem persists, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 6: Check your security software

 The antivirus and malware checkers can close down or block the normal operation of certain applications, even if they are legitimate and safe. To ensure the Microsoft Flight Simulator works properly, you can add the game to the exclusions list. Here’s how:

#### Windows Defender

#### Other antivirus programs

 The way to add Microsoft Flight Simulator as an exception to your antivirus software will vary depending on the software you’re using. You can refer to your security software’s support website.

 Sample of Virus & malware checkers that have been known to prevent Microsoft Flight Simulator from launching:

* Malwarebytes
* Trend Micro Maximum Security
* Comodo Antivirus
* Sophos
* Emisoft Anti-Malware
* Avira
* Avast & Avast Cleanup
* Bullguard

 Check if the game loads normally after you add it as an exception to your security software.

 If you still can’t get past the checking for updates screen, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 7: Use a VPN

 If your connection is poor, you may experience the issue of Microsoft Flight Simulator being stuck on the checking for updates screen. To gain a better Internet connection, you can give a VPN a try.

 **But note that we don’t like free VPNs as they are usually a catch.** A paid VPN subscription guarantees smooth gameplay even during rush hours.

Here are some gaming VPNs we recommend:

* [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Surfshark](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [CyberGhost](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

If this method doesn’t solve your problem, check out the last fix.

### Fix 8: Do a clean install

 If none of the fixes above solve your problem, try uninstalling and reinstalling the game completely. Before doing a clean install, search the[Bugs & Issue forum](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/c/bugs-and-issues/200)  in case other players shared additional troubleshooting steps.

#### Microsoft Store version

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type**Microsoft Flight Simulator** .
2. Select**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MFS-uninstall-pc.jpg)
3. Click**Uninstall** again to remove the game.
4. Once uninstalled, check to make sure all files are deleted. The default installation location is:  
 **C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.FlightSimulator\_8wekyb3d8bbwe**  
 Note: If you have installed the packages in a custom folder, search for that folder instead.
5. Move any leftover files or folders to the Recycle Bin.
6. **Reinstall** the game from the Microsoft Store.

#### Steam version

1. Go to your Steam**Library** .
2. Right-click Microsoft Flight Simulator and then select**Manage** and click on**Uninstall** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/uninstall-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator.png)
3. Click on **Uninstall**  to confirm your choice.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/uninstall-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-Confirm.png)
4. Once uninstalled, check to make sure that all the packages are deleted. The default package installation location is: **C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft Flight Simulator\\Packages**  
 Note: If you have installed the packages in a custom folder, search for that folder instead.
5. Move any leftover files or folders to the Recycle Bin.
6. **Reinstall** the game from Steam.

 Check if you can get past the checking for updates screen.
