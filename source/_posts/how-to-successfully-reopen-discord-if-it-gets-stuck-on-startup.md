### Fix 3 – Adjust the Zoom settings

 If you’ve constantly disconnected and reconnected your camera, the Zoom’s settings may be messed up. To ensure your camera is correctly selected, you should check the app settings. Here is how.

2. Click the**gear icon** at the top right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-6.jpg)
3. Select the**Video** tab. Then choose the correct camera from the drop-down menu.

 Check if the Zoom video issue is solved now. If not, there are two more fixes to try.

### Fix 4 – Update your camera driver

 If the camera driver on your PC is faulty or outdated, you may encounter the Zoom cannot start video issue. To keep your camera working at the best performance, you should update its driver to the latest.

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update the driver manually. Just visit the website of your camera manufacturer, download the latest driver that’s right for your operating system, and install them manually.

 But if you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged webcam driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you‘ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

 A driver update can well tackle various types of camera issues. But if this doesn’t help your case, try the last method.

### Fix 5 – Reinstall Zoom

 If you’ve walked through the process above but still can’t get the camera working, try reinstalling Zoom as the last resort. This should help you resolve some deeper program issues.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and R to invoke the Run box. Type in**appwiz.cpl** in the field and click**OK** .
