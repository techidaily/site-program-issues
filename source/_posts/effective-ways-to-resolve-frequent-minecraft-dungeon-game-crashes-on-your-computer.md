### Fix 5: Update your device drivers

 Drivers are essential programs that let your operating system communicate with your devices. If there are any faulty or outdated drivers, you’re likely to experience high CPU usage in Zoom. Updating your drivers may eliminate compatibility issues or bugs that cause increased CPU usage.

 Here’re mainly two ways to update your device drivers —**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your device drivers manually via Device Manager or by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for the exact device. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DE-update-all.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC and check if your problem has been resolved.

If the issue persists, check out the next fix.

### Fix 6: Reinstall Zoom

 If all of the fixes above fail to solve your problem, you may need to consider reinstalling Zoom as a last resort. Sometimes a fresh install could help you fix the high CPU usage issue. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Then type or paste**control appwiz.cpl** in the field and click**OK** .
