4. Once done, enter the game and play as you normal would.

 If the issue reoccurs after a scan and repair, you can take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2:**Update your graphics driver**

 Crashes in COD series are usually graphics-related — It could mean your game encountered a compatibility issue triggered by a**broken or outdated graphics driver** . That’s why we always recommend gamers to keep their drivers up to date: new drivers improve your gaming experience and most importantly, they would also fix compatibility issues like lagging and constant crashing.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your PC for it to take full effect. Then join a game in Warzone and test the gameplay.

 If the latest GPU driver doesn’t stop the crash, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 Microsoft rolls out Windows updates periodically, which includes security patches and some nice-to-have new gimmicks. In addition to drivers, you should also**make sure your system is up to date** so as to avoid some strange issues.

Here’s how you can check for updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win** (the Windows logo key). At the bottom left corner of your screen, click the**gear icon** to open Settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-gear-icon.jpg)
2. Scroll down and select**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update.jpg)
3. Click**Windows Update** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-2.jpg)
4. Click**Check for updates** . Then wait for the process to complete. After that, restart your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-3.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 Once you’ve installed all the Windows updates, restart your PC and check if error has disappeared.

 If Warzone crashes with the same error again, you can try the next method below.

### Fix 4: Reinstall all shaders

 Shaders refer to a type of program used largely for rendering of different pixels. Some players reported that**reinstalling shaders** could be a potential fix for the dev error, so you can try the same and see if it helps.

To do this, simply follow these steps:

1. Launch Modern Warfare and go to**Options** .
2. Navigate to the**GRAPHICS** tab. Click**Restart Shaders Installation** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/warzone-reinstall-shaders-1.jpg)
3. Click**RESTART** to proceed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/warzone-reinstall-shaders-2.jpg)
4. Wait for the process to complete. Then restart your game and test the gameplay

 If reinstalling shaders doesn’t give you luck, simply move on to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Change your loadouts, skins and operators

 The dev error could also be a glitch inside the game. According to some players, changing to Modern Warfare loadouts seemed to have stopped the error from appearing. So if you’re using**loadouts or operators** from Black Ops Cold War, change them to the Modern Warfare ones and check the outcome. In the meantime,**remove all your skins** .

### Fix 6: Change to another account

 There’s also feedback showing that the dev error 6634 issue might be limited to certain accounts. So if possible, consider**testing another account on the same computer** . If the problem disappears after changing the account, then you need to compare the difference between two accounts, including but not limited to loadouts, skins and operators.
