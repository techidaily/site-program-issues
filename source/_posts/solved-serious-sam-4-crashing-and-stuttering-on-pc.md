### Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the minimum hardware requirements

 The PUBG stuttering issue may occur if your PC fails to meet the minimum hardware requirements of the game. Check if your PC meets its minimum hardware requirements:

* **The minimum hardware requirements for PUBG:**

| **OS:**        | 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:** | Intel Core i5-4430 / AMD FX-6300                   |
| **Graphics:**  | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 2GB / AMD Radeon R7 370 2GB |
| **Memory:**    | 8 GB RAM                                           |
| **DirectX:**   | Version 11                                         |
| **Network:**   | Broadband Internet connection                      |
| **Storage:**   | 30 GB available space                              |

 As we all know, it’s never the ideal way to play PUBG with a PC which just meets its minimum hardware requirements. So we also list the PUBG recommended system requirements below.

* **The recommended system requirements for PUBG**

| **OS:**        | 64-bit Windows 10                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:** | AMD Ryzen 5-1600 / Intel Core i5-7600K |
| **Graphics:**  | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB or better  |
| **Memory:**    | 8 GB RAM                               |
| **DirectX:**   | Version 11                             |
| **Network:**   | Broadband Internet connection          |
| **Storage:**   | 30 GB available space                  |

 You may need to upgrade your hardware if your PC fails to meet the minimum system requirements of the game.

### Fix 2: Run PUBG in windowed mode

 PUBG consumes lots of resources when running in fullscreen mode. If your PUBG keeps stuttering when you play it in fullscreen mode, try running it in windowed mode.

**To switch PUBG to windowed mode:** While in the game, on your keyboard, press**Alt** and**Enter** at the same time.

 See if your PUBG keeps stuttering. If this annoying issue persists, try the next fix.
