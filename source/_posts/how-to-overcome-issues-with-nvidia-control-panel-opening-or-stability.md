 Halo 3 could be crashing because you’re running it beyond your computer’s abilities. So make sure your computer meets the requirements for the game.

| OS                | Windows 7 x64-based                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| CPU               | Intel Core i7-975 \| AMD A 12-9800 APU |
| GPU               | GeForce GTS 450 \| Radeon R7 Graphics  |
| Storage           | 55 GB available                        |
| Screen resolution | 1920\*1080                             |

_Halo 3 Minimum System Requirements_

 If your computer meets these requirements but still Halo 3 doesn’t launch properly, try the methods below.

## Fix 1: Stop apps from running in the background

 Generally, the game crashes because it’s running out of memory or overheating. So to save data usage and system resources, you can stop some apps from running in the background by following these steps:

## Fix 2: Temporarily disable antivirus software

 There will be conflicts between antivirus scans and your enjoying your games. To avoid this, you’re supposed to try temporarily disabling your antivirus software.

 Click the links below and follow the instructions to disable the antivirus software you’re running:

## Fix 3: Update your video card drivers

 A range of gaming problems such as crashing and freezing is caused by a wrong, faulty, or outdated graphics driver. Halo 3 is no exception. To enjoy smooth gameplay, you should always keep your graphics driver up to date.

 You can search for the latest graphics driver from your graphics card’s manufacturer [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and then manually install it. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

Here’s how to update your drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

## Fix 4: Perform a clean boot

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard to open the Run box.

 2) Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 5) Under the**Startup** tab in the Task Manager window, right-click on each**Enabled** Startup item, then click**Disable** . After that, close the window.

![perform a clean boot](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/perform-a-clean-boot-5.jpg)

7) Restart your computer and it’ll be in a clean boot environment.

## Fix 5: Run Halo 3 as an administrator

 1) Right-click the**Halo 3** icon on your desktop and select**Properties** .  
  
![open as an administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-Properties.jpg)
  
 2) Click the**Compatibility** tab and click**Run this program as an administrator** . Click**Apply** and**OK** .

## Fix 6: Install the latest game patch

 When a new game is released, there are still many bugs in it. And those bugs might cause the game crash issues. So developers keep updating the games to fix the bugs and improve the gaming performance.  
  
 So if there is a patch available, download and install it, then run the game again to check if the problem is solved. If it isn’t, or there is no new patch available, then move on to Fix 7.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 7: Verify the integrity of game files

 1) Run Steam  
  
 2) Click the**LIBRARY** tab.
