First, check your current Microsoft Visual C++ version:

1. Type **control**  in the Windows search box and click **Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-21_12-23-58.jpg)
2. Click **Programs** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If your Microsoft Visual C++ version is outdated, follow the steps to update it:

1. Visit the **[Microsoft Visual Studio website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)**  .
2. Scroll down and click the**link** matching your OS to download the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages.

If the Cult of the Lamb continues to crash, try the next fix.

## Fix 2 Repair HDD bad sectors

 A bad sector in computing is a disk sector on a disk storage unit that is damaged. Files stored in this sector will be lost or malfunctioned. Therefore, if your game files are located in the bad sector of the drive, it may cause the Cult of the Lamb to crash. Logical bad sectors can be detected and repaired following the steps:

1. Type**cmd** in the Windows search bar and click**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cmd.jpg)
2. Copy and paste the following command. Remember to replace**e:** with the drive storing your game file.

2. Choose the**Compatibility** tab. Then tick the box**Run this program as an administrator** , and click **Apply**  and **OK**  to save changes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/skywalker-saga-crash-1.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/skywalker-saga-crash-2.jpg)

 Steam will verify the files of this game for you. Once done, exit the software client and launch it again. Have a test to see if the crashing issue is gone.

## Fix 6 Repair system files

 As problem game files, flawed system files can lead to Cult of the Lamb crashing. Some problem system files (eg. missing or corrupt DLL files) might even affect the system’s running. So you may want to run a quick and thorough scan to see if problems exist.

[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a trusted application offering system repair solutions for years.

## Fix 7 Add the game to whitelist

 Sometimes antivirus may overprotect your computer by blocking some data transfer which is essential for video games, causing games to crash or freeze.

 If you’re using any antivirus, these tools may have a negative impact on your gaming experience. To eliminate their effect, you can add the game to your antivirus whitelist. If you don’t know how to do it, just google your antivirus’s name and whitelist (eg. McAfee whitelist). Then follow the official guidelines to add Cult of the Lamb to its white list.

## Fix 8 Disable overlay

 It’s reported that some overlay apps may conflict with Cult of the Lamb, producing a crashing or freezing screen. If you’re using overlay software such as Discord or Xbox, disable them temporarily. In addition, some games have a problem pairing with the Steam overlay, so also disable the overlay on Steam with the steps below:

1. Open Steam client.
2. Navigate to the **Steam**  \> **Settings**  \> **In-game** tab.
3. Uncheck **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/stray-not-launching.jpg)

 Relaunch Steam after you have disabled apps and Steam overlay. Open the game to see if the problem is gone.
