## Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 Another possible cause of the HLL crashing issue is program conflicts. If there is a certain program conflicting with HLL, it will lead to the crashing issues. In this case, you need to perform a clean boot to find out the problematic program that crashes the game. Here's how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.  
![msconfig-win-10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/msconfig-win-10.png)
2. Navigate to the **Services** tab, check **Hide all Microsoft services** and then click **Disable all** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration.png)
3. Select the **Startup** tab and click **Open Task Manager** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration2.png)
4. On the **Startup** tab in **Task Manager** , for **each** startup item, select the item and then click **Disable** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration3.png)
5. Go back to the **System Configuration** window and click **OK** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration4.png)
6. Click **Restart** to restart your PC.  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration5.png)

 Restart Windows OS and launch tha game to check if HLL crashes again. If HLL doesn't crash, you need to open the**System Configuration** window again to enable services and applications **one by one** until you find the problematic software that crashes HLL.

 After enabling each services, you need to restart your PC to apply the changes.

 Once you find out the problematic software that crashes HLL, you need to**uninstall** it to avoid game crashing issues in the future.

 If the game still crashes after you disabled all the 3rd party apps and services, try reinstallingHell Let Loose .
