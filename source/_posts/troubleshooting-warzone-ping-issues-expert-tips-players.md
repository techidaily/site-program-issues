### Fix 3:   **Reset the Microsoft Store cache**

 Overtime, Windows caches downloads made through Windows Store. This can take up a lot of space and cause problems when downloads come to a halt. So you can reset the Microsoft Store cache to fix problems like this and see if it solves the Gear 5 crashes issue.

Here is how to reset the Microsoft Store cache:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Windows-logo-key-5.png) and type **R** at the same time, then type **wsreset.exe** and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-127.png)

2) Wait until the whole Windows store cache reset process finishes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-128.png)

3) Once completed, Windows Store will pop open.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-129-1024x796.png)

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Check to see if the Gears of War 4 crashes issues have been fixed. If yes, then great! If it still persists, please try **Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: **Check for Windows Updates**

 The game crash problem may also lie with Windows itself. If this is the case, then you should check Windows to see if there is any updates for the game.

Here is how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **I** at the same time. Once the **Windows Settings** window pops up, click **Updates & Security** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-141.png)

### Fix 5: Update DirectX

 DirectX is a suite of components in Windows that allows heavy multimedia apps such as games to interact with your video and audio cards. If you’re running an old version of DirectX, it’s possible that it won’t be able to handle the graphics rendering and processing task, which might cause the Gears of War to crash. So you should update DirectX to the latest version to see if it fixes the issue.

 If you’re not sure which version of DirectX your computer is running, or how to update DirectX, please refer to this **[quick guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Once you’ve updated DirectX, check to see if the game crashes issue is fixed.

 Still not resolved? Please try **Fix 6** , below.

 Once you’ve reinstalled Gears of War 5 on your PC, run it to see if it still crashes.
