### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics driver, also called a video card driver, is essential to the functioning of video games. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you’re likely to encounter the crashing issue in Psychonauts 2\. To fix the potential problem and get the best performance out of your hardware, you should make sure your computer’s graphics driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ( **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**  ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, then it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  

 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your computer and launch Psychonauts 2 to see if the game crashes again.

If the issue persists, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: Verify the integrity of game files

 If the game’s files are missing or corrupted, you may experience crashing while playing Psychonauts 2\. To fix the issue, you can have Steam verify that the game’s files are installed correctly on your computer. Here’s how:

1. Go to the Steam**Library** .
2. Right-click Psychonauts 2, select**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/psychonauts2-properties.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-verify-game-files-1.jpg)
4. Steam will verify the game’s files. This process may take several minutes.

Once done, relaunch Psychonauts 2 to see if the problem is resolved.

If the crashing issue remains, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Launch the game in DX11 mode

 If you receive a “LowLevelFatalError” error message when Psychonauts 2 crashes, then try launching the game in DX11 mode. This was suggested by the game developers. To do so:

1. Go to the Steam**Library** .
2. Right-click Psychonauts 2, select**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/psychonauts2-properties-1.jpg)
3. In the GENERAL section, enter**\-dx11** under LAUNCH OPTIONS.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-launch-options-dx11.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 This will force the game to run in DX11\. Then you can launch Psychonauts 2 again to see if the error still occurs.

If this fix doesn’t do the trick, try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Check your firewall and antivirus settings
