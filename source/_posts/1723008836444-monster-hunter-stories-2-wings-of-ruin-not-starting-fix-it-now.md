## Fix 1: Make sure Minecraft is using the dedicated GPU

 Sometimes the operating system won’t recognize Minecraft as a game and won’t run it with the dedicated GPU for high performance. If that’s the case for you, you’re likely to experience stuttering in Minecraft. To fix it, you can force the game to use the dedicated GPU via Graphics settings. Here’s how:

1. Right-click your desktop and select**Display settings** from the menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/display-settings.jpg)
2. In Display settings, scroll down the page and select**Graphics settings** .

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Minecraft is a graphics-intensive game, so your graphics card is essential for its performance. You cannot have an outdated or faulty driver on your graphics card since this is usually what causes stuttering in Minecraft. To update your graphics driver, there are two ways you can try: manually and automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](http://nvidia.com/drivers) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ,[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) ) for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation.

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3090-Ti.jpg)
4. After updating, restart your computer to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your computer and check if Minecraft stutters again.

If the stuttering issue persists, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Lower your Render Distance

 In Minecraft, chunks make up your world. And the render distance controls how many chunks of the world are visible at once. So if you set a high value of chunks, you may face the issue of fps drops or stuttering. To get better performance, you should lower the value to 8 or less, depending on your PC’s hardware. Here’s how:

1. Run Minecraft on your computer.
2. Click**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/options.jpg)
3. Click**Video Settings** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/video-settings.jpg)
4. Lower the**Render distance** according to your need.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/render-distance-1.jpg)

This should give you a better game experience.

But if it doesn’t, take a look at the next fix.

## Fix 4: Enable VSync

 Sometimes the stuttering issue might occur due to a frame rate discrepancy between the monitor and GPU. But luckily you can fix it by enabling VSync in your graphics control panel.

### Via NVIDIA Control Panel

1. Right-click your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
2. In the left panel, select**Manage 3D Settings** , then click the dropdown menu next to**Vertical sync** and select**On** . Click**Apply** to save changes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amdradeon-settings.jpg)
2. Click the**Gaming** Tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amd-gaming-1.jpg)
3. Then click**Global Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amd-global-settings-1.jpg)

## Fix 5: Turn off threaded optimization

 Threaded optimization is a setting in NVIDIA Control Panel that controls the use of multithreaded optimization for all 3D games on systems with multi-core/HyperThreaded CPUs. Most new games perform better with threaded optimization enabled. However, some gamers reported that they fixed the stuttering issue in Minecraft by turning off threaded optimization. You can give it a shot. To do so:

1. Right-click your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** from the menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
2. In the left panel, click**Manage 3D settings** , navigate to the**Program Settings** tab, and select**Minecraft Launcher.exe** from the first dropdown menu.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/step1.jpg)
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the list and find the**Threaded optimization** , then click the dropdown menu next to it and**change the value from Auto to Off** . Click**Apply** to save changes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/step2.jpg)

After doing so, restart Minecraft and check if the problem is resolved.

If the stuttering issue remains, try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Allocate more RAM

 The RAM helps computers improve frame rates and frame pacing during gaming. In many cases, you need to allocate more RAM to games, especially for the games that use a lot of mods, like Minecraft. To do so:

1. Open your**Minecraft client** and navigate to the**Installations** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Installations1.jpg)
2. Click the**three dots** button next to Minecraft, then select**Edit** from the dropdown menu.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/edit.jpg)
3. Click**MORE OPTIONS** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/more-options.jpg)
4. Under the**JVM ARGUMENTS** section, there’s a line of text. **Change the amount of RAM that Minecraft can utilize after Xmx** (for example, Xmx4G means Minecraft is allowed to use 4GB RAM). Then click**Save** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4g-save.jpg)

Launch Minecraft and see if this helps fix the stuttering.

If this solution doesn’t work, take a look at the next fix.

## Fix 7: Uninstall OptiFine

 OptiFine is a Minecraft optimization mod, which allows the game to run faster and look better. However, it consumes some resources and may cause the stuttering issue. To see if that’s the case for you, you can try uninstalling OptiFine.

 If the stuttering issue remains after uninstalling OptiFine, check out the last fix.

## Fix 8: Reinstall Minecraft

 If none of the methods above seem to work for you, try reinstalling the game as a last resort. First, uninstall the current version of Minecraft from your computer, then reinstall the latest version of it. After that, relaunch the game to check if the stuttering issue is solved.
