### Method 2: Use a wire connection

 It’s recommended to use an ethernet connection instead of WIFI. Although WIFI is convenient to use, it’s less stable than a wire connection, especially for online gaming.

**Tip** : Stop downloading other files while hosting with your friends to play Outriders.

 If you’re already using an ethernet connection, please to move to the next fix.

### Method 3: Update your drivers

 The game has had graphic driver issues in the past that would show performance worsen. On the other hand, network driver would affect your internet connection. Therefore we recommend to update your graphic driver and network adapter driver.

 You can manually update these drivers by going to the manufacturer’s official websites, but there’s an easier way — use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to automatically update your drivers.

[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact network adapter/ graphic card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 That’s it, hope it helps. The issue mostly relates to the game servers so there’s not much we can do. Hope the lagging issue would be fixed at launch.
