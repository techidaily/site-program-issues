| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Processor:** | Intel Core i5 or AMD equivalent      |

### Fix 1: Check Fall Guys server status

 Sometimes, the launching problem is an issue with Steam or with Fall Guys server. Try doing a quick Google search to see the official status of Fall Guys servers, or check **[@FallGuysOwl](https://twitter.com/FallGuysOwl)**  on Twitter.

 If it turns out to be a server issue, then wait patiently for the developer to fix it. If the game server works fine, then the issue may be on your side. Move on to the next fix below.

### Fix 2: End unnecessary programs

 If your game is unable to gain access to the memory it needs, it will either crash or run into other performance issues. So, it’s always wise to close background programs that take up a lot of PC memory. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Ctrl, Shift and Esc keys** at the same time to open Task Manager.

**2)** Right-click the programs you want to close and select **End Task** .

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

### Fix 3: Update the graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues like game crashing. So, make sure your graphics driver is updated.

 You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, (such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en)**  ,[**Intel**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) or **[Nvidia](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ,) and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
