### Fix 4: Update your driver

 As a game player, the graphics card is one of the most important components of your PC. If the graphics driver is outdated or corrupted, you may not be able to enjoy the game. Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel constantly release new graphics drivers to fix bugs and improve gaming performance and experience, but Windows won’t always provide you with the latest version.

So, there are two ways that you can update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. You need the Pro version of Driver Easy to do this, so you’ll be prompted to upgrade.

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 5: Reset your character account

 According to players, somehow resetting your character account could fix the Star Citizen crashing issue. You may have a try. At least it’s not a complicated fix.

1. Go to the[site](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/) and log in to your account.
2. Click**Settings > Character reset** .
3. Click**Reset Request** .

### Fix 6: Increase page file size

 This tip has worked for some users. By increasing page file size on your SSD, leaving enough room for the game is a pretty important element that affects how Star Citizen runs.

 Make sure you have enough free space on SSD and run the game in low settings with V-sync off.

### Fix 7: Reset or reinstall Windows

 If all else fails, you may have to[reset Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , or maybe even[reinstall it](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) together. We all know reinstalling will delete all the data on your hard drive, you have to[back up all your important files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) before doing it.  
 However, with[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , there’s **no need for lengthy back-ups, support phone calls, or risk to your personal data** . It can reset Windows to the state exactly when it was just installed without affecting third-party software.

 The Pro version of Fortect comes with 24/7 technical support. If you need any assistance, please contact Fortect support:  
 Email: **<support@fortect.com>**

 But treat these options as a last resort, because they both take quite a long time.
