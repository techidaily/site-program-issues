## Method 4: Disable SMT

**SMT** (Simultaneous MultiThreading) is a multi-threading technology released by AMD to improve performance of its Ryzen CPUs. However, SMT can bring about issues of unstability with some applications on your system. You should try disabling SMT to see if this can fix your Rainbow Six crashing issues. To disable SMT, you should enter your motherboard**BIOS** . Then find your**SMT** or**SMT mode** setting and set it to**disabled** .

 You may need to consult the**manual** of your motherboard to enter BIOS and change the SMT setting.  

 If you can’t find the SMT setting on your motherboard BIOS, you should try going to the**official support website** of your motherboard to get and install the**latest update for BIOS** . Then re-enter your BIOS and see if there is an SMT setting on it.
