### Fix 1\. Check for the latest version of the game

1. Go to your Steam**Library** .
2. Right-click**Terraria** and click**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/INTEGRITY-1.png)

 That will scan your game directory and compare it to the most updated version to find file differences and download files it’s missing.

### Fix 2\. Check if you’re playing different styles

 This error**Terraria Lost Connection** will occur if you don’t have a character to coordinate with the type of map.

 If you have a Classic Map or try to join someone’s Classic Mode game, you should have a Classic Character. Likewise, if you have a Journey Map / want to join a Journey Mode game, you should have a Journey Character.

 Make sure to create a character accordingly before and you won’t be seeing the**Connection Lost** error in Terraria.

### Fix 3\. Deactivate Windows Firewall

 Make sure your Windows Firewall (as well as your antivirus software) is not blocking the connection. To do that, you will need to turn off Windows Firewall and uninstall your antivirus software temporarily. Here’s how:

 If you don’t feel so sure about turning off your Firewall, you can add Terraria to its exception list. Type**Allow an app through Windows Firewall** in the Search box and follow the on-screen instructions to continue.

1. Type**windows defender firewall** in the Search box, and select**Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/win-11-windows-defender.jpg)
