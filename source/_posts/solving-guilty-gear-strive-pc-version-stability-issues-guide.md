![verify the integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1-2020-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)

 Launch the game after the verifying process completed and see if HLL crashes again. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. The outdated or broken graphics driver often crashes the game.

 The graphics card manuafacturers like Nvidia and AMD keeps releasing new graphics drivers so that they can fix bugs in the previous versions of graphics drivers and enhance graphics performance for their products.

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 In order to get a better FPS, many players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card. However, overclocking often crashes the game.

 See if HLL crashes after you stopped overclocking. If this fix failed to resolve this issue, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 Another possible cause of the HLL crashing issue is program conflicts. If there is a certain program conflicting with HLL, it will lead to the crashing issues. In this case, you need to perform a clean boot to find out the problematic program that crashes the game. Here's how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.
