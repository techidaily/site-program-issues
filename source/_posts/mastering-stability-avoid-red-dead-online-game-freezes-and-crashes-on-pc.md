## Try these fixes

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Uninstall incompatible software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Reinstall the game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Verify games files via Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your graphics card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Run as the administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Uninstall incompatible software

 Sometimes the third party software can interfere with your game. So uninstall the newly installed software to see whether it can help. If you have Razer Chroma SDK, Razer Synapse or Roccat Mouse driver installed on your PC, you’d better uninstall it and see whether it solves the Frostpunk crash issue.  
 Except for these drivers, your antivirus software may be the reason for the Frostpunk crash issue. So, disable your antivirus software and try downloading again to check if the issue persists.

 If this resolves your problem, you may need to replace your antivirus software or contact the vendor of the software for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.

### Fix 2: Reinstall the game

 Fully uninstalling and reinstalling the game is an old easy but effective method. The game profile can be crashed which cause the Frostpunk crash. So doing a clean reinstall can fix the issue.

If it doesn’t work, you can move to the next fix.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 You can download graphics drivers the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.
