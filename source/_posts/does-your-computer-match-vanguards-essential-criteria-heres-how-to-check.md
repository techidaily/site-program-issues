## Does Your Computer Match Vanguard's Essential Criteria? Here's How to Check

Some gamers have met this Fatal Error message: **Your CPU does not meet the minimum specification for running Call of Duty: Vanguard** . It confused some players as they can perfectly run Warzone, Modern warfare which is bigger and takes more process, how could their CPU doesn’t meet the minimum specification for running COD: Vanguard?

 Don’t worry, you’re not alone. This post will explain it to you and help you fix the issue.

#### The minimum specification to play COD: Vanguard

| OS            | Windows 10 64 Bit (latest update)             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| CPU           | Intel Core i3-4340 or AMD FX-6300             |
| RAM           | 8GB RAM                                       |
| Storage space | 36GB at launch (Multiplayer and Zombies only) |
| Video card    | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or AMD Radeon RX 470   |
| Video memory  | 2GB                                           |
| DirectX       | DirectX 12                                    |

### Fix 1: Check if your CPU supports AVX

 If your CPU meets the minimum specification table, you need to check whether it includes AVX instruction sets. It was written in the[Vanguard PC system requirements](https://www.callofduty.com/vanguard/pc) ‘ notes section, indicating only Intel/AMD processors**with AVX Instruction Set** are supported at this time.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-2.png)

 AVX instructions set are built into the processor, it’s not something you can upgrade or add on. Many older i7 CPUs may outperform the i3-4340 and FX-6300 but don’t include AVX instructions sets, that’s probably why they can’t launch the game.

 Not all CPUs support AVX, if you meet the fatal message indicating your CPU doesn’t meet the minimum requirements of running Vanguard, you can search your processor to check if it supports AVX.

#### How do I know if my CPU supports AVX?

 The easiest way to find is to look it up on the manufacturer’s website. Search the CPU model number on the search engine and look it up on the manufacturer’s website.

 1) Search your CPU on the search engine. Click the manufacturer’s official webpage on the result page.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-3.png)

 2) In the open window, press**Ctrl + F** and type**avx** . If you see AVX on the page, your CPU supports the AVX instruction set, otherwise, it’s not.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-4.png)

i3-4340 supports AVX instruction sets.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-5.png)

i7-970 doesn’t support AVX instruction sets.

 If your CPU doesn’t support AVX, either use another CPU that supports AVX or apply for a refund.  
 Maybe the COD: Vanguard will roll out some kind of non-AVX support in the future or update the game to be compatible with older CPUs. But there’s no way to fix it right now.

 If your CPU supports AVX but still encounters this fatal error message, you can move to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Reboot your PC

 There are gamers who have played the game for over 10 hours suddenly receive this error, maybe not for CPU but for GPU. It can be fixed after a system restart.

1) Exit Call of Duty: Vanguard completely.

2) Click the**start** button and click the**power** button.

3) Click**Restart** .

4) Reboot COD: Vanguard and check if the issue persists.

If it’s not working, move to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphic drivers

 In some cases, the message is not about CPU but saying your GPU doesn’t meet the minimum requirements, you can update your graphics driver to the latest version to solve the issue.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ) and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
